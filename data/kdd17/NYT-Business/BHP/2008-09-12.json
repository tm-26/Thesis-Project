The number of people employed rose 14,600 last month, the Australian Statistics Bureau said. Economists had forecast an increase of 5,000. The jobless rate fell to 4.1 percent, from 4.3 percent. The number of full-time jobs rose about 7,500 in August and part-time jobs increased roughly 7,200. The August employment gain followed a revised increase of 18,700 jobs in July. Demand for skilled labor at companies including BHP Billiton is helping generate new jobs.
