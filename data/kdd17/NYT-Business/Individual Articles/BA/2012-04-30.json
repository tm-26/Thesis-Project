Microsoft has invested $300 million for a 17.6 percent stake in a new Barnes & Noble\u2019s subsidiary composed of its Nook digital-book business and college-texts units; intriguingly, the deal values the subsidiary at $1.7 billion, much more than Barnes & Noble is worth by itself, as The Wall Street Journal noted. Also, as part of the deal, Microsoft has settled its patent dispute with Barnes & Noble, and there will be a Nook application included in the new Windows 8, which is scheduled to have a release preview in early June.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: Microsoft Buys Into the Nook, and Radio\u2019s Shrinking Diversity", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2012-04-30T13:24:09+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Noam Cohen", "person": [{"firstname": "Noam", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Cohen", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/6dad4b3c-96e2-5575-bb0a-60815a0f00f7", "word_count": 425, "uri": "nyt://article/6dad4b3c-96e2-5575-bb0a-60815a0f00f7"}
