Although the percentage of TV viewers who rely on the Internet exclusively is negligible, television executives are concerned that many consumers are being missed regularly. Most Internet viewings of TV shows are not counted in Nielsen\u2019s ratings because they are shown without commercials or with different commercials than when they aired on television \u2014 and new streaming services, like Aereo and one in the works from Intel, stream shows and ads without cable. The expanded ratings will allow executives to count customers that these types of services may steal away from cable.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: Nielsen Adds Web-Linked TVs to Ratings, and a Tight Oscar Race\u2019s Final Recap", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2013-02-22T13:52:52+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Daniel E.
