Advocates of e-cigarettes say they are less harmful than conventional cigarettes, because users inhale nicotine-infused vapors instead of smoke. Despite the products\u2019 growing popularity, some European public health officials want them regulated as medical devices. Even if tobacco industry lobbyists prevail in getting the European Parliament to back a less stringent form of regulation, the vote would be only a step in a European rule-making process for e-cigarettes that could continue into next year or beyond.
