The guarantee covers up to 70 percent of Southern\u2019s eligible projected costs, the company said Friday. \u201cThis is another step forward on the road to nuclear power playing a prominent role in America\u2019s energy future,\u201d David Ratcliffe, the chief executive, said in a statement. Southern would be the first to receive federal aid under a five-year-old law aimed in part at helping add nuclear stations, which usually cost more and take longer to build than coal or natural-gas-fired generators. Southern plans to add two reactors to its Vogtle station near Waynesboro, Ga., in 2016 and 2017.
