The company, Learfield Communications, of Jefferson City, Mo., owns multimedia rights to more than four dozen college sports programs and made just under $40 million last year in a common measure of earnings. It borrowed the money from Deutsche Bank and GE Capital on Oct. 9. Though the loans were rated subprime, with few of the standard protections seen in ordinary debt, investors clamored to buy pieces of the loans, one of which pays annual interest of at least 8.75 percent.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A New Credit Boom", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2013-11-27T13:09:20+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By William Alden", "person": [{"firstname": "William", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Alden", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/387acfb5-781a-5119-b88f-62b4a538c3d5", "word_count": 2035, "uri": "nyt://article/387acfb5-781a-5119-b88f-62b4a538c3d5"}
