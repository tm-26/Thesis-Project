The Federal Court awarded the amount to Graeme R. Peterson, 59, in a case against Merck Sharpe & Dohme (Australia), the plaintiff\u2019s law firm, Slater & Gordon, said Friday. The court found that Vioxx contributed to Mr. Peterson\u2019s heart attack in 2003, according to the judgment. Merck said in a statement that it would appeal. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., withdrew Vioxx in 2004 after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
