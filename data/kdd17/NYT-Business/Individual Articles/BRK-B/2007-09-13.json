Buffett sold about 1.1 billion Hong Kong dollars worth ($141 million) of shares in the PetroChina Company, his second sale in two months, amid calls for United States investors to reduce holdings in China\u2019s biggest oil producer because of its links to Sudan. Mr. Buffett\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, sold 92.66 million shares at an average of 11.473 Hong Kong dollars on Aug. 29, a Hong Kong stock exchange filing showed. That reduced his stake to 9.72 percent of the stock not controlled by the Chinese government from 10.16 percent. Berkshire made a more than sixfold gain on the sale, having bought its PetroChina stake for less than 1.70 Hong Kong dollars a share in April 2003.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "10", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "China: Buffett Sells Petrochina Shares", "kicker": "World Business Briefing", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "China: Buffett Sells Petrochina Shares", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "PetroChina Company Limited", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Berkshire Hathaway Incorporated", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Buffett, Warren E", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2007-09-13T04:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "World Business", "byline": {"original": "By Bloomberg News", "person": [{"firstname": "Bloomberg", "middlename": null, "lastname": "News", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Brief", "_id": "nyt://article/df63af74-2a30-59e0-9855-3e68ac65b5cc", "word_count": 123, "uri": "nyt://article/df63af74-2a30-59e0-9855-3e68ac65b5cc"}
