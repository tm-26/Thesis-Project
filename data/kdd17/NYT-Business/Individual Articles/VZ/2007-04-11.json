{"abstract": "We hate to pile on a company when it\u2019s down, but we couldn\u2019t resist running some numbers on Vonage Holdings, the upstart Internet-based phone company whose initial public offering last year has gone from bad to worse to apocalyptically awful. With the latest downtick in Vonage\u2019s stock, coming after a federal judge ordered it to stop using technology licensed by Verizon, the I.P.O. is by far the worst of 2006, according to Thomson Financial. At $3, the stock has lost more than 82 percent of its value since last May, when it was sold to the public at $17 apiece. The shares are now below the average price paid by Vonage\u2019s pre-I.P.O. investors, a prestigious group of venture and private equity investors including New Enterprise Associates, Meritech Capital Partners, 3i, and Bain Capital.
