The bid, a cash and stock proposal, values Coca-Cola Amatil at 10.35 dollars a share, a 25 percent premium over the closing price Friday. If successful, the acquisition would give Lion Nathan a 60 percent share in Australia\u2019s soft-drink market, which is valued at 10.3 billion dollars, Reuters reported. Coca-Cola Amatil said the offer contained \u201ca number of material deficiencies\u201d and was \u201cmaterially below recent multiples paid for domestic and international beverage companies.\u201d It said the deal was unlikely to be supported by Coca-Cola of Atlanta, which owns 30 percent of Coca-Cola Amatil, its Australian distributor. Kirin Brewery, the Japanese beer maker, holds a 46 percent stake in Lion Nathan. Lion Nathan said the deal would create the largest beverages company in Australia and New Zealand, with diversified holdings in soft drinks, beer, wine and spirits. Coca-Cola Amatil recently expanded into alcohol by starting a joint venture with SAB Miller, selling Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Miller Genuine Draft.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "11", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Australia: Hostile Bid Made for Coca-Cola Unit", "kicker": "World Business Briefing | Australia/new Zealand", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "AUSTRALIA: HOSTILE BID MADE FOR COCA-COLA UNIT", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Australia", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Coca-Cola Amatil Limited", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Soft Drinks", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2008-11-18T07:24:40+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "World Business", "byline": {"original": "By Meraiah Foley", "person": [{"firstname": "Meraiah", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Foley", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Brief", "_id": "nyt://article/5612db02-9de2-57e5-915e-054cc122ce2e", "word_count": 185, "uri": "nyt://article/5612db02-9de2-57e5-915e-054cc122ce2e"}
