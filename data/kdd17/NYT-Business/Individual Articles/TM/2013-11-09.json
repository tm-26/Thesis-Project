Chrysler said it was aware of seven accidents involving the Rams, resulting in two injuries. The automaker estimated that 453,000 of the trucks would need repairs because the steering systems\u2019 tie rods were not aligned properly, though it said it would need to recall all 1.2 million trucks to find the flawed vehicles. Meanwhile, Toyota also said it was recalling about 3,800 of its Tacoma pickups from the 2013-14 model years because their 4-cylinder engines could be damaged and possibly stop running.
