The surprising part is that it didn't plummet even more.  After closing at $30 Friday, Bear's stock hovered at about $4 late Monday morning, suggesting that investors expected to get something more than what JPMorgan has offered. But what? The securities firm was nearly forced to shut its doors because of a severe liquidity crunch. As a company that was preparing a bankruptcy filing over the weekend in case the sale effort failed, Bear seems to be in no position to negotiate.   A number of possibilities come to mind.  Investors may think that JPMorgan will increase its price, if only to avoid being seen as a vulture. Theoretically, Bear's shareholders can vote against the deal, though it would take 12 months to reject it fully under Sunday's merger agreement.  Though the deal price is about $270 million, JPMorgan has said that the true cost of acquiring Bear will be much higher -- as much as $6 billion -- when litigation, severance and other costs are taken into account. So in principle, increasing the per-share price would have a relatively small effect on the overall cost of buying Bear.  Wall Street seems to think JPMorgan is getting a huge bargain: Shares of JPMorgan were up 10 percent Monday, even as other financial firms took a nosedive. Its market capitalization grew by $12 billion, paying for Bear Stearns several times over.  Investors may also be putting hope in the idea that another bidder could step up, such as a private equity firm.  That could be difficult, however. Many analysts think JPMorgan's close ties to Bear, including its role as the go-between for Bear's federally backed bailout loan, have already put it at an advantage over other buyers.
