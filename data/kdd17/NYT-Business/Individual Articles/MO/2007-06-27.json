{"abstract": "The Altria Group, the cigarette maker, will close a North Carolina factory and increase European production to save $335 million a year by 2011. The shutdown of the plant in Cabarrus County will result in a one-time charge of $325 million in the second quarter, Altria said. The company, which is based in New York, may be preparing to spin off its international unit, analysts and investors said. Factories in Europe will take over production of Marlboros and other cigarettes bound for Japan and the Middle East, which are currently being made in North Carolina. All of Altria\u2019s United States output will be shifted to Richmond, Va. Closing the North Carolina facility, which employs 2,500, will cost about 10 cents a share in the second quarter, Altria said. Expenses will total $670 million by 2011.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/business/worldbusiness/27fobriefs-ALTRIATOEXPA_BRF.html", "snippet": "The Altria Group, the cigarette maker, will close a North Carolina factory and increase European production to save $335 million a year by 2011.
