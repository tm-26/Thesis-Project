Failure to pay the E.C.B. would have forced the bank to cut off emergency funding for Greek banks, causing them and the Greek economy to collapse. The debt payments represent a step back from the precipice of a eurozone exit for Greece, but the government led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must cope this week with the political turmoil caused by his decision to accept unpleasant conditions set by eurozone creditors in return for financial aid. In a move toward normalcy, Greek banks reopened on Monday. \u2014Jack Ewing", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/07/20/business/20SUBAhead1/20SUBAhead1-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 665, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2015/07/20/business/20SUBAhead1/20SUBAhead1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 665}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/07/20/business/20SUBAhead1/20SUBAhead1-jumbo.jpg", "height": 1024, "width": 924, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/07/20/business/20SUBAhead1/20SUBAhead1-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 2048, "width": 1848, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/07/20/business/20SUBAhead1/20SUBAhead1-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2015/07/20/business/20SUBAhead1/20SUBAhead1-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/07/20/business/20SUBAhead1/20SUBAhead1-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Greece\u2019s Debt Payments, Apple Earnings and Credit Suisse Results", "kicker": "The Week Ahead", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010- )", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Greece", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Morgan Stanley", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Apple Inc", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Alzheimer's Disease", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Bank of England", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Credit Suisse Group AG", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "General Motors", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Food and Drug Administration", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2015-07-20T01:20:28+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By The New York Times", "person": [], "organization": "The New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/0d52adb3-5828-5d10-8445-95bd613e8c66", "word_count": 907, "uri": "nyt://article/0d52adb3-5828-5d10-8445-95bd613e8c66"}
