On Tuesday, it will release trade figures for August; exports have been flat so far this year, and imports declined 15 percent in the first seven months of 2015. Other reports include inflation figures on Wednesday and industrial output, investment and retail sales on Saturday. Investors will also be watching on Monday for August data on China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. While still the world\u2019s largest, China\u2019s reserves are expected to have declined after the surprise devaluation last month of its currency, the renminbi, which has raised concerns over capital outflows. \u2014 Neil Gough", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type":
