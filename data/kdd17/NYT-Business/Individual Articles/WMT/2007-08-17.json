Sales climbed 0.7 percent after gaining 0.4 percent in June, which was twice as much as previously reported, the Office for National Statistics said. Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, and Asda, owned by Wal-Mart Stores, cut prices on thousands of products to attract customers during the wettest summer on record. The gain in retail sales was led by electronics and furniture, the statistics office said. Household goods stores reported a 13.4 percent annual increase in sales, the biggest since October 2001. Retail sales rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier. Analysts said the strong figures would encourage the central bank to raise interest rates.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "7", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Britain: Retail Sales Post Gain", "kicker": "World Business Briefing", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Britain: Retail Sales Post Gain", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Great Britain", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RETAIL STORES AND TRADE", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Sales", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2007-08-17T04:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "World Business", "byline": {"original": "By Bloomberg News", "person": [{"firstname": "Bloomberg", "middlename": null, "lastname": "News", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Brief", "_id": "nyt://article/d38634d7-faaa-5077-ab3c-09512932be03", "word_count": 126, "uri": "nyt://article/d38634d7-faaa-5077-ab3c-09512932be03"}
