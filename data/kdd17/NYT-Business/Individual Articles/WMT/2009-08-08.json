Target, the second-largest discount retailer in the United States, after Wal-Mart, will take over building and managing Target.com before the 2011 holiday season, the company said in a statement on Friday. Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, agreed in 2001 to provide customer care, technology and order fulfillment for Target.com to help the discount retailer lower costs and improve customer service. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very positive, productive relationship with Amazon,\u201d Kelly Basgen, a Target spokeswoman, said. However, she added, \u201cWe just thought it was in our best interest to grow and manage our own platform.\u201d Target said it would work with Amazon until the contract expired.
