Mead Johnson\u2019s stock fell 5.1 percent to $65.29, after plunging 10 percent on Thursday when Walmart pulled the formula. Supervalu also has withdrawn the formula, a spokesman said. Officials screening samples of the formula and water used to prepare it said results might not come until next week. The newborn tested positive for Cronobacter sakazakii, an environmental bacterium that can be fatal. Another child infected with the bacterium in Missouri had also been given formula, though officials said on Friday that the baby, who survived, ingested other types of products as well. The brand of formula given to the second baby was not disclosed.
