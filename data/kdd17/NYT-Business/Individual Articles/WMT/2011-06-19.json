First, they can send us garbage (postage paid), and for each piece of waste they collect, we typically give 2 cents to the charity or school of their choice. Today, more than 21 million people in the United States are actively involved in our collection programs, and there\u2019s another 2 million participating outside of the United States. The second way to interact with TerraCycle is for consumers to buy the products that are made from the waste we\u2019ve collected. These products are typically available at major big-box stores, including Wal-Mart and Target.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "How Do You Engage Your Customers?", "kicker": "You&#039;re the Boss", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2011-06-19T16:00:04+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Entrepreneurship", "byline": {"original": "By Tom Szaky", "person": [{"firstname": "Tom", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Szaky", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/a4af9b70-d6b6-5f0d-8102-08880d95bdc3", "word_count": 752, "uri": "nyt://article/a4af9b70-d6b6-5f0d-8102-08880d95bdc3"}
