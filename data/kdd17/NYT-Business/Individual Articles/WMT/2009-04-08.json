Same-store sales fell in part because March had one fewer Saturday than last year and Easter, which was in March in 2008, is in April this year, the company said in a statement. Total revenue last month rose 5.9 percent to 21 billion pesos ($1.56 billion), the company, based in Mexico City, said. The number of transactions fell 0.5 percent on a comparable-store basis, said the company, known as Walmex. The value of the average transaction dropped 0.6 percent. Wal-Mart Stores owns two-thirds of Walmex.
