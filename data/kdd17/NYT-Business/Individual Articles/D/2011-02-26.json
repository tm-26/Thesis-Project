On Friday, the federal government revised its calculation of fourth-quarter growth to 2.8 percent from 3.2 percent. In the Weekend Business podcast, Catherine Rampell explains why: the turmoil in the Middle East has sent oil prices soaring. Investors fear that the unrest will spread to other countries, further disrupting production.

Taken together, the uncertainty means businesses are unlikely to invest, let alone hire more workers.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Podcast: Economic Turbulence, and a Call for Fed Action", "kicker": "Economix", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Economic Conditions and Trends", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "United States Economy", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Kroll, Jules B", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Romer, Christina D", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Federal Reserve System", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-02-26T04:25:16+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Economy", "byline": {"original": "By Jane Bornemeier", "person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Bornemeier", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "", "_id": "nyt://article/49e02dfb-ae98-59b0-96bf-506343052c97", "word_count": 459, "uri": "nyt://article/49e02dfb-ae98-59b0-96bf-506343052c97"}, {"abstract": "Richard D.
