Many cameras will let you disable the logo screen and jump right into the live viewfinder, which saves start-up time. Just go to the camera\u2019s menu or settings area and look for a \u201cstart-up screen\u201d or similar option, then choose not to use it; check your camera\u2019s manual for specific instructions. Within the camera\u2019s menus, you should also be able to adjust the length of the review time each photo stays on the LCD screen after you snap it. By decreasing the time the last image stays on screen, you can get back to shooting photos more quickly. J. D.
