Although its main function is to display PDF files, the free Adobe Reader software (www.adobe.com/products/reader) has a Read Aloud feature that can audibly recite the contents of many PDF files. To hear it for yourself, open a PDF file, go to the View menu and activate the feature from the Read Out Loud submenu. While copy-protected e-books may not be compatible with Read Out Loud, it is fine for works in the public domain, like books in PDF files from Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.us), academic papers and other PDF files.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Tip of the Week: Let Your Documents Do the Talking", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Electronic Books and Readers", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ADOBE SYSTEMS INC", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2009-04-08T20:48:03+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Technology", "subsection_name": "Personal Tech", "byline": {"original": "By J.D.
