Its earnings per share were 32 cents below the average of five analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 11 percent to nearly $60 billion during the quarter. Chevron\u2019s American refineries lost an average $2.2 million a day during the final three months of 2011 as crude-processing margins shrank and maintenance work at a California plant curbed fuel output, the company said in a statement. Chevron added the equivalent of 1.67 billion barrels in reserves last year, enough to replace 171 percent of the oil and gas the company pumped last year.
