(He also writes a monthly math column for the Brazilian national science magazine, Ci\u00eancia Hoje (Science Today), called Qual o Problema, or \u201cWhat\u2019s the Problem?\u201d). Dr. Moriconi found this week\u2019s puzzle in a blog by its creator, Roy Cook, a professor of philosophy at the University of Minnesota who tells how he momentarily stumped the famous paradox master Raymond Smullyan with the challenge.
