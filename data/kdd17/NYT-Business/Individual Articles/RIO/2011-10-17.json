The executive, Michael C. Woodford, was brought in to clean house at the company, and became one of Japan\u2019s handful of foreign corporate bosses.

It also strengthens the case for a bigger dose.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2011/10/18/business/Views/Views-jumbo.jpg", "height": 973, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Olympus Chief Goes, but Push for Reform Goes On", "kicker": "Reuters Breakingviews", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Firing Highlights Olympus\u2019s Woes", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Aluminum", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Olympus Corp", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Woodford, Michael C", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Rio Tinto PLC", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Appointments and Executive Changes", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-10-17T23:49:40+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Wayne Arnold and John Foley", "person": [{"firstname": "Wayne", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Arnold", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}, {"firstname": "John", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Foley", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 2}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/7472201e-254a-5b0b-a9e8-ac716ade512a", "word_count": 717, "uri": "nyt://article/7472201e-254a-5b0b-a9e8-ac716ade512a"}
