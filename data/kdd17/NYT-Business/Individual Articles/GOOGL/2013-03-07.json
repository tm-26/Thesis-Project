The announcement came hours after negotiations on a possible merger between Meredith Corporation and many Time Inc. titles fell through. The deal did not work out in part because of Time Inc.\u2019s concern about flagship titles Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, which Meredith had decided not to pursue. Time Warner found it made more economic sense to spin off all its titles rather than retain a few of them, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said. Time Inc. is the nation\u2019s largest magazine publisher, and the breakdown in talks threw into sharp relief how once-glamorous magazines have become troubled assets.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: Time Warner to Spin Off Time Inc., and Facebook\u2019s New Look", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2013-03-07T14:10:08+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Daniel E.
