Because it\u2019s my second computer, I didn\u2019t want to spend money on software. Whenever I used it to create documents, I figured I\u2019d just work in \u201cthe cloud,\u201d meaning that I\u2019d store things on the Internet rather than on the computer\u2019s hard drive. I was already a heavy user of Google Docs, a free word-processing application that allows users to easily share documents with other people. So I thought I\u2019d just use that as my word processing program on the new computer.
