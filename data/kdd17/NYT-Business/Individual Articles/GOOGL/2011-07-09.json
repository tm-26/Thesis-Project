Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, has agreed to testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing on the company\u2019s dominance of the Internet search industry, yielding to the panel\u2019s demands. Mr. Schmidt will testify in September, the company said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to accommodate\u201d the subcommittee, said Mistique Cano, a spokeswoman for the company. The move resolves a standoff between the company and the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, which had threatened to subpoena Mr. Schmidt or Google\u2019s chief executive, Larry Page. The subcommittee plans to examine whether Google is using its position as owner of the world\u2019s most popular search engine to hurt competition in the Internet industry. The Federal Trade Commission, the European Union and the State of Texas are looking into accusations by Internet companies that Google favored its own services in search results and increased ad rates on its rivals.
