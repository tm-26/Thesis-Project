{"abstract": "When last we left the new Big Ten Network \u2014 in a column I wrote last October \u2014 the new all-Big-Ten-sports-all-the-time network was in a long struggle to gain carriage with the big cable companies, starting with Comcast, Time Warner and Charter Communications. The cable guys were outraged because the Big Ten wanted a dollar per subscriber per month \u2014 nearly triple the price commanded by, say, CNN or the USA Network \u2014 and was further demanding a primo spot on extended basic, which is where everybody who starts a network wants to be. For their part, the cable companies wanted to relegate the Big Ten Network to a sports tier, where the fans who watched the games would also be the ones who pay for them. For the record, while I do not believe in a la carte cable pricing, I do think that sports should be treated as an exception: sports channels are so expensive \u2014 ESPN alone is some $3 a month a subscriber \u2014 that it is the single biggest reason your cable bill is so high. Putting sports channels on a sports tier makes sense, it seems to me.", "web_url": "https://executivesuite.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/the-big-ten-winssort-of/", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "When last we left the new Big Ten Network \u2014 in a column I wrote last October \u2014 the new all-Big-Ten-sports-all-the-time network was in a long struggle to gain carriage with the big cable companies, starting with Comcast, Time Warner and Charter Communications.
