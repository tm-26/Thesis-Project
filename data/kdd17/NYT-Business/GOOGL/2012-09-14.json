The USA Today Web site, which will be unveiled this weekend, has been redesigned to resemble an e-reader, with a smoother scroll from page to page. The twist, however, is that the abundance of information on the Internet has largely taken away what made the national newspaper special 30 years ago. The moves are part of a broader rethinking by USA Today\u2019s parent company, Gannett, to consolidate the news gathering of its TV and newspaper assets.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: USA Tomorrow?
