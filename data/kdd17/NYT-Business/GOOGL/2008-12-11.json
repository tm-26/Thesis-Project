Like many of Google\u2019s new products, Chrome first appeared in a beta, or test, version. That limited its appeal, as corporate users in particular tend to shy away from using software that is still in test mode. Perhaps as a result, Chrome\u2019s share of the Web browser market  is less than 1 percent. In the new browser wars, that\u2019s a rounding error compared with Internet Explorer\u2019s nearly 70 percent market share.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Google\u2019s Browser Sheds Its \u2018Beta\u2019 Label", "kicker": "Bits", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-12-11T21:31:14+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Technology", "byline": {"original": "By Miguel Helft", "person": [{"firstname": "Miguel", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Helft", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/07bf5cdb-8877-511f-84f1-434f91afdcdf", "word_count": 259, "uri": "nyt://article/07bf5cdb-8877-511f-84f1-434f91afdcdf"}
