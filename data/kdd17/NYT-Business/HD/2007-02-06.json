But the move could increase pressure on Home Depot to sell one of its units. Under the terms of the agreement, Relational, a San Diego investment fund, will receive a seat on the company\u2019s board and four directors involved in hiring Robert L. Nardelli, the recently dismissed chief executive, will leave the board in 2008. A founder of Relational, David H. Batchelder, will join the Home Depot board on Feb. 22, and the investment fund will drop its proxy challenge, the two companies said in a joint statement.
