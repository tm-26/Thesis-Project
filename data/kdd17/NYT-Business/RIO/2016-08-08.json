It was also\u00a0a nice surprise\u00a0to find\u00a0Karen Crouse\u2019s\u00a0story about\u00a0Bruce Gemmell, an old college teammate of mine and current coach of swimmer\u00a0Katie Ledecky. I\u2019ve spent as much time immersed in water as enveloped by math problems, and it\u2019s good to see so many friends and\u00a0fast swims down in Rio.
