The bump in the offer price, to more than $191 a share, or nearly $60 billion in cash and stock, signals yet another twist in the year\u2019s longest and most contentious takeover battle. It could affect the thinking of Allergan\u2019s board, which is working to strike other deals that would thwart the attempted takeover by Valeant and Pershing Square. And it could sway Allergan shareholders, who are preparing for a special meeting in December at which they will have the chance to vote out a majority of the Allergan board.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Morning Agenda: Another Twist in Allergan Battle", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2014-10-08T11:44:57+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Sydney Ember", "person": [{"firstname": "Sydney", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Ember", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/a6c8886b-b73b-5771-933a-883730d89b40", "word_count": 2057, "uri": "nyt://article/a6c8886b-b73b-5771-933a-883730d89b40"}
