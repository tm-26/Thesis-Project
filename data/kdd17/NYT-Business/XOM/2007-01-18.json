{"abstract": "Exxon Mobil said output from its $17 billion Sakhalin Island development in the Pacific off Russia jumped 40 percent in the last month. Oil and natural gas production from the Sakhalin-1 development has risen to the equivalent of more than 200,000 barrels of crude a day, according to Stuart McGill, senior vice president. Exxon, which operates and owns a 30 percent stake in the project, expects output eventually to reach the equivalent of 317,000 barrels a day. Production at Sakhalin-1 was about 160,000 barrels a day in early December, a Bear Stearns analyst, Nicole Decker, said in a Dec. 13 note to clients after an analysts\u2019 lunch with Exxon\u2019s chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson. Exxon began producing crude from the Chayvo field off Sakhalin Island\u2019s ice-choked coastline in October 2005. Exxon\u2019s partners in Sakhalin-1 are a Japanese group known as Sodeco, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India and the state-run Russian oil company Rosneft.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/business/worldbusiness/18fobriefs-SAKHALINPROD_BRF.html", "snippet": "Exxon Mobil said output from its $17 billion Sakhalin Island development in the Pacific off Russia jumped 40 percent in the last month.
