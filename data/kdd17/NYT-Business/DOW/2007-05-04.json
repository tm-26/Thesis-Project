{"abstract": " Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bombshell $5 billion bid for Dow Jones has a lot of legal types talking make-up. More specifically, they\u2019re talking about Revlon, the subject of a 1985 ruling that helped define a corporate board\u2019s duties when a company is up for sale. Dow Jones, like The New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, has a dual-class share structure that gives majority voting power to its controlling family and insulates it from the whims of Wall Street. But the Bancroft family\u2019s initial resistance to News Corp.\u2019s overture raises questions. What are the board\u2019s responsibilities when a controlling family rejects offers that minority shareholders would jump at? In particular, how do the so-called Revlon duties play into these situations?
