The fines reflect the government\u2019s anger over Chevron\u2019s handling of the spill. Chevron may also face additional fines and legal penalties, officials said. Haroldo Lima, head of the National Petroleum Agency, said the spill could complicate Chevron\u2019s hopes of gaining access to new offshore exploration areas. Federal investigators said Chevron employees might also face prison terms. Chevron said in a statement that it had not yet received official notice of any fines and would respond if it did.
