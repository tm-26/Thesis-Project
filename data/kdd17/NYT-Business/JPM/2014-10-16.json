Late Wednesday, AbbVie, based in Illinois, said it would recommend that its shareholders vote against approving the deal in the event that it is put to a vote. In particular, AbbVie indicated that the new Treasury rules, which targeted the ability of companies that moved abroad to use overseas cash on a tax-free basis, had made the deal for Shire less financially attractive.
