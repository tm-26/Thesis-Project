In the wake of new rules penalizing such inversions, AbbVie has walked away from its bid to acquire the Irish drug maker Shire for $54 billion. Late Wednesday, AbbVie, based in Illinois, said it would recommend that its shareholders vote against approving the deal in the event that it is put to a vote. In particular, AbbVie indicated that the new Treasury rules, which targeted the ability of companies that moved abroad to use overseas cash on a tax-free basis, had made the deal for Shire less financially attractive. The news sent shares of Shire tumbling in London.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Morning Agenda: AbbVie\u2019s Cold Feet", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2014-10-16T12:20:27+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Sydney Ember", "person": [{"firstname": "Sydney", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Ember", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/cd99f7dd-d01b-5ff8-85b9-a4bb6163bfc7", "word_count": 1892, "uri": "nyt://article/cd99f7dd-d01b-5ff8-85b9-a4bb6163bfc7"}
