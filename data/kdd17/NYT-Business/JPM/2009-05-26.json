[{"abstract": "UBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Depfa Bank have dropped an appeal against the seizure of $482 million of their assets amid an investigation of fraud.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/business/global/26bizbriefs-BANKS-BRF.html", "snippet": "UBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Depfa Bank have dropped an appeal against the seizure of $482 million of their assets amid an investigation of fraud.", "lead_paragraph": "UBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Depfa Bank have dropped an appeal against the seizure of 345 million euros ($482 million) of their assets amid an investigation of fraud involving derivatives sold to the city of Milan, said two lawyers representing the banks. The banks dropped the appeal at a hearing in Milan on Monday. The prosecutor is considering a May 7 request by the securities firms to put up about 100 million euros ($140 million) in exchange for having the assets returned, the lawyers said. Milan is suing the four banks after it lost money on derivatives it bought from the lenders in 2005. The banks earned about 101 million euros ($141.5 million) in what prosecutors called illicit profit from arranging the contracts. Officials for Deutsche Bank and Depfa declined to comment. The claims will be discussed in the course of the investigation, said UBS's lawyer Giuseppe Bana. Given \"the very short notice between the filing by the prosecutor of a large volume of documentation and the date set for the hearing it has not been possible adequately to address the relevant issues in time for the hearing. However, we are confident that the strength of our legal position will ultimately be demonstrated through the judicial process,\" a JPMorgan spokesman said in an e-mailed statement.
