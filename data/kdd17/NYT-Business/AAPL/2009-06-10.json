If you find the program displaying your photo thumbnails as gray rectangles, acting sluggish or generally misbehaving, take a look at iPhoto\u2019s built-in maintenance tools. Using these, you can rebuild the program\u2019s database, thumbnails and file permissions \u0097 and also recover unused space from the iPhoto database.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "9", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Tip of the Week: Apple\u2019s iPhoto Software", "kicker": "Q & A", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Electronic Mail", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Apple Inc", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Remote Control Systems", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2009-06-10T22:15:52+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Technology", "subsection_name": "Personal Tech", "byline": {"original": "By J.
