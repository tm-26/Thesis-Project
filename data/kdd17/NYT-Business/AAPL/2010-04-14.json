J.D. Biersdorfer chats with Mr. Kamen about his own early inspirations and about the nonprofit group he founded to encourage interest in these fields among the young. The organization, called First  (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), holds its 19th annual championship, with competitions in robotics, gaming and Lego construction, April 15-17 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.You might expect your brand new computer to have a clean hard drive, only to find programs installed on it that you didn\u2019t ask for, or trial versions of software that pester you to buy the full version or sign up for a service.
