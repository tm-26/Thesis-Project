So rather than present a top 10 list that includes names from 2010, I\u2019m including only apps that had their debuts this year. If you really want to turbocharge your device, combine these with last year\u2019s picks. (Note that this list doesn\u2019t include games, which will be the subject of a separate post on the Gadgetwise blog.) Like last year\u2019s list, this one includes many free picks.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "7", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2011/12/22/business/22-SMART1/22-SMART1-jumbo.jpg", "height": 676, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2011/12/22/business/22-SMART1/22-SMART1-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2011/12/22/business/22-SMART1/22-SMART1-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}], "headline": {"main": "Best iPhone Apps of 2011", "kicker": "App Smart", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Some New Little Treasures for the iPhone", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Apple Incorporated", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "iPhone", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mobile Applications", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "iTunes", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-12-21T21:31:13+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Technology", "subsection_name": "Personal Tech", "byline": {"original": "By Bob Tedeschi", "person": [{"firstname": "Bob", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Tedeschi", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/20c4c955-70d6-5d4a-8032-bc204a2eeec4", "word_count": 1072, "uri": "nyt://article/20c4c955-70d6-5d4a-8032-bc204a2eeec4"}
