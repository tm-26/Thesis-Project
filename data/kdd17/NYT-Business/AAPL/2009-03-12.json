The new one looks like a sleek aluminum tie clip, or maybe a slightly elongated stick of Trident gum; a AA battery hides it completely. There's just enough room on the back for a mirror-finish spring clip for fastening to your clothes. (If you order from apple.com, you can get a custom message laser-etched onto the clip.)", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "An iPod So Small Its Controls Are Found on the Cord", "kicker": "From the Desk of David Pogue", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-03-12T14:39:50+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Technology", "subsection_name": "Personal Tech", "byline": {"original": "By David Pogue", "person": [{"firstname": "David", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Pogue", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/85f5ba48-e505-502e-ba87-2af57b8bd7df", "word_count": 1088, "uri": "nyt://article/85f5ba48-e505-502e-ba87-2af57b8bd7df"}
