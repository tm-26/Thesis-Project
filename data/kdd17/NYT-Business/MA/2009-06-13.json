Ping An, a major insurer in China, agreed to purchase as many as 585 million new shares from Shenzhen Development for 10.7 billion renminbi, the company said. Ping An will also buy 520.4 million Shenzhen shares from Newbridge Capital, the Asian unit of TPG Inc., for about 11.45 billion renminbi. The stake of Ping An, which already owns 4.7 percent of the Chinese bank, may rise to as much as 34 percent after the transactions. The deal would extend a push by Peter Ma, Ping An\u2019s chairman, to build a financial supermarket, while helping Shenzhen Development plug a capital shortfall.
