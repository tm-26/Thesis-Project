The European Union opened investigations into whether manufacturers of polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, in those areas receive excessive government aid and sell in the 27-nation bloc below cost, a practice known as dumping. PET users include plastic-bottle mold makers and bottlers including Coca-Cola. Under European Union practices, the commission can impose provisional antisubsidy duties for four months and provisional antidumping penalties for six months.
