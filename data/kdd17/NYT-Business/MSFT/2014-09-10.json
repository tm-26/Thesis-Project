The move could further complicate Family Dollar\u2019s deal agreement to sell itself to Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion. In a statement, Dollar General said it was offering to acquire all of Family Dollar\u2019s shares for $80 each. That is the same bid that Family Dollar rejected last week, contending that the deal it agreed to with Dollar Tree had a better chance of passing muster with antitrust regulators. A hostile bid is likely to, at the very least, delay any deal between Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Morning Agenda: Dollar General Goes Hostile", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2014-09-10T11:44:42+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Sydney Ember", "person": [{"firstname": "Sydney", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Ember", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/9b7a4712-e0bb-52b7-81e4-ea12781543ba", "word_count": 1744, "uri": "nyt://article/9b7a4712-e0bb-52b7-81e4-ea12781543ba"}
