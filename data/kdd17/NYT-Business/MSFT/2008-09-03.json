You don\u2019t have to cut and paste a thing \u0097 and you can tell Word exactly how much fake text to supply. Say you want to add four paragraphs of three sentences each. In your document, just type in \u201c=rand(4,3)\u201d on its own line, without the quotation marks, and press the Enter key. Word fills the space with text in the requested amount of paragraphs and sentences. The content varies with the version of Word.
