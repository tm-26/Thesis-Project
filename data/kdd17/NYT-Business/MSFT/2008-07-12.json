A price reduction by Microsoft would be evidence that the Xbox 360 was falling behind in the contest for sales, Mr. Stringer said Friday in an interview at the Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. Microsoft may lower the price of the Xbox 360 as soon as this weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Sales of the console in the United States lagged behind Nintendo\u2019s Wii and the PlayStation 3 in the first five months of 2008, according to NPD Group, a market researcher.
