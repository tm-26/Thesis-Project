The approval came after Universal agreed to a series of concessions meant to foster competition even as the sale itself will reduce the number of major music labels to three from four. The concessions include the selling off about a third of EMI\u2019s assets including most of Parlophone, its flagship label in Europe, with acts like Coldplay, Pink Floyd and Kylie Minogue. A consolation for the newly enlarged Universal is that it will keep the Beatles.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: Universal-EMI Deal Passes in Europe, and Relief at News Corp.", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2012-09-21T13:35:06+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Noam Cohen", "person": [{"firstname": "Noam", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Cohen", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/81261d8b-9cce-594d-9cd4-e96b8b3c8de6", "word_count": 514, "uri": "nyt://article/81261d8b-9cce-594d-9cd4-e96b8b3c8de6"}
