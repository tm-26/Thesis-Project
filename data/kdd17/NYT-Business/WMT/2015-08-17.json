Walmart has invested heavily in its stores, as well as in its online business and work force, as part of a bid to overcome a prolonged decline in sales and market share. Still, analysts do not expect big results soon. On the other hand, Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, has been riding a recovery in the housing market to sales gains, and analysts expect it to book a solid quarter. Also reporting this week are TJX on Tuesday; Staples, Lowe\u2019s and American Eagle Outfitters on Wednesday; and Foot Locker on Friday. \u2014Hiroko Tabuchi", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/17/business/ahead1/ahead1-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 429, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2015/08/17/business/ahead1/ahead1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 429}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/17/business/ahead1/ahead1-jumbo.jpg", "height": 732, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/17/business/ahead1/ahead1-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1463, "width": 2048, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/17/business/ahead1/ahead1-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2015/08/17/business/ahead1/ahead1-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/17/business/ahead1/ahead1-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Retailer Earnings, Fed Minutes and Greek Debt", "kicker": "The Week Ahead", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Commerce Department", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Labor Department (US)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Company Reports", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Shopping and Retail", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Federal Reserve System", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Consumer Price Index", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Hewlett-Packard Company", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Greece", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2015-08-17T02:29:10+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By The New York Times", "person": [], "organization": "The New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/3a8583c4-8efa-548f-b500-aef5b7e334f0", "word_count": 563, "uri": "nyt://article/3a8583c4-8efa-548f-b500-aef5b7e334f0"}, {"abstract": "The perception of Amazon as a difficult place to work could force the online retailer to initiate reforms, as Walmart has done with its own billion-dollar program.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/business/dealbook/why-amazon-may-take-a-page-from-walmarts-labor-playbook.html", "snippet": "The perception of Amazon as a difficult place to work could force the online retailer to initiate reforms, as Walmart has done with its own billion-dollar program.", "lead_paragraph": "Amazon\u2019s latest results were so superb that they catapulted the online retailer\u2019s market value beyond that of Walmart Stores for the first time.
