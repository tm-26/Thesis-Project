In 2004, employees at Wal-Mart\u2019s store in Jonqui\u00e8re became the company\u2019s first North American personnel organized by the United Food and Commercial Workers. Wal-Mart argued that the store, about 290 miles north of Montreal, was unprofitable and that its 2005 closing was unrelated to the union.
