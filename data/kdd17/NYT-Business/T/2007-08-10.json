Second-quarter net income fell to 608 million euros ($831 million) from, 1.02 billion euros a year earlier, the company said. Sales rose 2.9 percent, to 15.6 billion euros. Revenue from abroad topped German sales for the first time after Deutsche Telekom lost 516,000 traditional phone lines in its home market while it added mobile phone customers in the United States. To help meet a 2 billion-euro cost-reduction goal this year, Deutsche Telekom moved 50,000 service employees into the new T- Service unit and cut their salaries, starting the biggest strike in more than a decade. The six-week strike ended in June after the Ver.di union agreed to a compromise reduction.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Germany: Strike Affects Telecom", "kicker": "World Business Briefing", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Germany: Strike Affects Telecom", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Germany", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Company Reports", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Telephones and Telecommunications", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Deutsche Telekom AG", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2007-08-10T04:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "World Business", "byline": {"original": "By Bloomberg News", "person": [{"firstname": "Bloomberg", "middlename": null, "lastname": "News", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Brief", "_id": "nyt://article/00ed08f0-b05d-566d-9001-8752f49ad31c", "word_count": 138, "uri": "nyt://article/00ed08f0-b05d-566d-9001-8752f49ad31c"}, {"abstract": "In the news today: Google and Microsoft battle with online storage, Universal Music tries to assert control, Comcast offers free Web video, and more.", "web_url": "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/10/quick-bits-att-sorry-about-censorship-fraudsters-invade-second-life/", "snippet": "In the news today: Google and Microsoft battle with online storage, Universal Music tries to assert control, Comcast offers free Web video, and more.", "lead_paragraph": "AT&T decided it shouldn\u2019t be in the censorship business.
