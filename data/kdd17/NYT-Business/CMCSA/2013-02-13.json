Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, said that the acquisition was a necessary step given the rapidly changing television business and the necessity of owning content. Comcast bought a 51 percent share in NBCUniversal in early 2011, with the option of buying the rest of the company over the next seven years; the process was accelerated at least in part by a clash in corporate cultures between G.E. and Comcast. The deal will also include 30 Rockefeller Plaza and the CNBC headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., for about $1.4 billion. Naming rights are included in the deal, so the red G.E. sign atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza could be replaced with a Comcast logo.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: Comcast Buys Rest of NBCUniversal, and Sites That Appeal to Book Lovers", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2013-02-13T14:11:39+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Daniel E.
