As Brian Stelter reports, resident students at Harvard and, of as of last week, Yale, can use a service created by Tivli to stream local TV stations, a couple of dozen cable channels and the universities\u2019 own in-house channels to computers, tablets or video game consoles. This ability, available anywhere on campus, may be part of the answer to a conundrum for the television industry. Young people watch less TV than they used to, and some say they do not see the point of an expensive cable or satellite subscription. If they become accustomed to viewing programming through services like HBO GO while in college, however, some believe it could lead them to become cable subscribers after they graduate.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: Courting Future Cable Subscribers, a Newspaper Reality Show, and a Saucy Ad Campaign", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Newspapers", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Radio", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Reality Television", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Comcast Corporation", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Harvard University", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Home Box Office", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "National Broadcasting Co", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ALASKA", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Chicago (Ill)", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Montana", "rank": 10, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2013-01-28T13:00:57+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By The Editors", "person": [], "organization": "The Editors"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/710f5f6f-1195-58fd-9311-7c56f659498b", "word_count": 481, "uri": "nyt://article/710f5f6f-1195-58fd-9311-7c56f659498b"}
