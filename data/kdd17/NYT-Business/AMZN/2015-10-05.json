No major decisions are expected at the meeting, the first of its kind since Greek voters returned Alexis Tsipras to power as prime minister last month. But it will be an opportunity for Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, to reassure ministers that his country is carrying out the reforms required to continue tapping the bailout, worth up to 86 billion euros, or about $96.5 billion. On Tuesday, the ministers, joined by their counterparts from European Union countries outside the single-currency zone, will try to reach a political deal on a law forcing the bloc\u2019s 28 member states to exchange information about preferential tax agreements like those granted by Luxembourg to Amazon, and by the Netherlands to Starbucks. -James Kanter", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/10/05/business/05AHEADsub/05AHEADsub-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 419, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2015/10/05/business/05AHEADsub/05AHEADsub-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 419}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/10/05/business/05AHEADsub/05AHEADsub-jumbo.jpg", "height": 715, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/10/05/business/05AHEADsub/05AHEADsub-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1431, "width": 2048, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/10/05/business/05AHEADsub/05AHEADsub-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2015/10/05/business/05AHEADsub/05AHEADsub-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/10/05/business/05AHEADsub/05AHEADsub-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Finance Ministers Meet to Discuss Greek Bailout", "kicker": "The Week Ahead", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010- )", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Greece", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2015-10-05T00:10:35+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By The New York Times", "person": [], "organization": "The New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/f6909f66-bf4e-5c76-8f69-47e871c27216", "word_count": 879, "uri": "nyt://article/f6909f66-bf4e-5c76-8f69-47e871c27216"}
