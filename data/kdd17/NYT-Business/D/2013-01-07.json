Visitors will wear rubber bracelets encoded with credit card information allowing them to buy everything from corn dogs to Mickey Mouse ears with a tap of the wrist. Smartphone alerts will signal when it is time to ride Space Mountain without standing in line. The ambitious plan, as Brooks Barnes reports, moves Disney deeper into the hotly debated terrain of personal data collection. Like most major companies, Disney wants to have as much information about its customers\u2019 preferences as it can get, so it can appeal to them more efficiently. The company already collects data to use in future sales campaigns, but parts of MyMagic+ will allow Disney to track guest behavior in minute detail for the first time.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: A Digital Kingdom and the Future of TVs", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "AMUSEMENT AND THEME PARKS", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Antitrust Laws and Competition Issues", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Cable Television", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Electronics", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Television Sets", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Google Inc", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Walt Disney Company", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2013-01-07T13:01:41+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By The Editors", "person": [], "organization": "The Editors"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/3e61ece0-c892-583c-b759-bf003ee2f8de", "word_count": 637, "uri": "nyt://article/3e61ece0-c892-583c-b759-bf003ee2f8de"}
