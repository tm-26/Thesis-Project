Ryan of Wisconsin over the weekend to be his running mate is being credited with shoring up Mr. Romney\u2019s conservative bona fides \u2014 something his campaign would have known because conservative publications had been telling him through editorials that he should pick Mr. Ryan to shore up his conservative bona fides. The Weekly Standard and The Wall Street Journal both wrote editorials promoting Mr. Ryan for the Republican ticket: The Journal\u2019s editorial on Thursday (Why Not Paul Ryan?) and The Weekly Standard\u2019s editorial dated Monday but online earlier (Go for the Gold, Mitt!). Perhaps this is the reason, Michael Barbaro writes, that Mr. Romney\u2019s camp was eager to announce the day he made the decision, Aug. 1: \u201cMr. Romney is sensitive to the perception that he acts at the behest of the party\u2019s right wing.
