And because we don\u2019t like to discuss such things in polite company, it is certainly unsurprising that six years later, not a single fundamental aspect of how Wall Street pays its top people has changed. The incentive system that handed out millions of dollars in bonuses to bankers and traders who packaged shoddy mortgages into securities and sold them as AAA-rated investments remains intact and no doubt is well on its way to planting the seeds for the next Wall Street-inspired financial crisis.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/10/08/business/dealbook/dbpix-scene/dbpix-wall-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 381, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2014/10/08/business/dealbook/dbpix-scene/dbpix-wall-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 381}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/10/08/business/dealbook/dbpix-scene/dbpix-wall-jumbo.jpg", "height": 651, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/10/08/business/dealbook/dbpix-scene/dbpix-wall-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1302, "width": 2048, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/10/08/business/dealbook/dbpix-scene/dbpix-wall-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2014/10/08/business/dealbook/dbpix-scene/dbpix-wall-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/10/08/business/dealbook/dbpix-scene/dbpix-wall-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "I.M.F.
