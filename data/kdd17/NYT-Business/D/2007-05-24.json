{"abstract": "The Bank of Montreal said second-quarter profit rose 3 percent as higher fees from mutual funds and stock sales offset a big loss in commodities trading. Net income climbed to 671 million Canadian dollars ($618 million) from 651 million Canadian dollars a year earlier, the bank said. Record mutual fund sales and rising demand for loans contributed to a 24 percent increase in consumer banking profit, countering the commodities losses, which were related to natural gas trading. The bank said on May 17 that it would report a pretax trading loss of 680 million Canadian dollars. Bank of Montreal said profit was 1.31 Canadian dollars a share excluding the trading loss and other one-time items, an increase of 3.1 percent from a year ago. Revenue in the quarter, which ended April 30, rose 2.7 percent, to 2.57 billion Canadian dollars from 2.5 billion Canadian dollars.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/business/worldbusiness/24fobriefs-PROFITUPATBA_BRF.html", "snippet": "The Bank of Montreal said second-quarter profit rose 3 percent as higher fees from mutual funds and stock sales offset a big loss in commodities trading.
