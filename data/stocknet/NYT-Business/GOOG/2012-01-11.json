But the operation appeared to be running on fumes. Once a winner was crowned \u2014 at 8 p.m., precisely when all polls were closed \u2014 the topic turned to second place. That, too, was over early, with Ron Paul declared the runner-up in that same hour. The focus then turned to South Carolina, and how Mr. Romney would fare in a state that would test his conservative credentials: CNN had already assembled a group of undecided Republicans there, Mr. Stelter writes, while Fox News promoted its debate there on Monday.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: The Spielberg Exception and Who\u2019s Illin\u2019?", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Crossword Puzzles", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Indecency, Obscenity and Profanity", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Presidential Election of 2012", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Slang", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Television", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Kagan, Elena", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Romney, Mitt", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Shortz, Will", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Spielberg, Steven", "rank": 10, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Federal Communications Commission", "rank": 11, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Google Inc", "rank": 12, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "New York Times", "rank": 13, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Supreme Court", "rank": 14, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Twitter", "rank": 15, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2012-01-11T13:48:30+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Noam Cohen", "person": [{"firstname": "Noam", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Cohen", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/620402f6-35fb-5c46-a4fa-0d85049121d7", "word_count": 503, "uri": "nyt://article/620402f6-35fb-5c46-a4fa-0d85049121d7"}
