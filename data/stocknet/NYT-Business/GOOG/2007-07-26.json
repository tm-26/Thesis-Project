Trip-booking sites like Orbitz.com offer alerts for delays and cancellations. Google\u2019s SMS feature can give you updates from FlightStats.com. Just address a text message to 466453 (GOOGLE). Type in the flight number (\u201cAmerican 684\u201d or \u201cNW 102\u201d for example) and send it off to have Google ping you back with the flight and gate information.
