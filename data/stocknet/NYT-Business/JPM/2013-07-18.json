Including charges, profit rose to $802 million, or 41 cents a share, from $564 million, or 29 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. But the results were affected by two big charges, one related to credit spreads and the other to Morgan Stanley\u2019s recent purchase of the remaining stake of its wealth management business. Excluding those charges, the profit was $872 million, or 45 cents a share. That beat the 43-cents-a-share average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. A conference call to discuss the results is scheduled at 10 a.m.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Morgan Stanley Beats Estimates", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2013-07-18T12:36:44+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By William Alden", "person": [{"firstname": "William", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Alden", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/bad7c745-8eeb-5ff1-8b55-4b2afd2c04b3", "word_count": 1672, "uri": "nyt://article/bad7c745-8eeb-5ff1-8b55-4b2afd2c04b3"}
