That\u2019s if Renren is anything to go by. Shares in Renren, China\u2019s answer to the social networking giant, surged more than 25 percent on their first day of trading on Wednesday. That meant it was valued at nearly 100 times last year\u2019s revenue. On that basis, Facebook is worth about $200 billion. Goldman bought in at just a quarter of that. With some bubbly assumptions, the higher figure can almost be supported.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2011/05/05/business/Views/Views-jumbo.jpg", "height": 973, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Renren May Skew Facebook\u2019s Value", "kicker": "Reuters Breakingviews", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Renren May Skew Facebook\u2019s Value", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Portugal", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Stocks and Bonds", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010- )", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Goldman Sachs Group Inc", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-05-05T01:28:35+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Jeffrey Goldfarb, Hugo Dixon and Neil Unmack", "person": [{"firstname": "Jeffrey", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Goldfarb", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}, {"firstname": "Hugo", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Dixon", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 2}, {"firstname": "Neil", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Unmack", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 3}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/7271b96c-40b4-50b4-9090-2ea6173f064e", "word_count": 698, "uri": "nyt://article/7271b96c-40b4-50b4-9090-2ea6173f064e"}
