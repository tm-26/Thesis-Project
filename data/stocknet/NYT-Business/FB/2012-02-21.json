On Monday, the High Court in London said that the Pirate Bay \u2014 an index of torrent files, which allows users to transfer large files including movies and music \u2014 violated copyright laws on a large scale. The court is expected in June to rule on whether Internet service providers can block access to the site. In a Facebook post later that day, the Pirate Bay\u2019s operators repeated their recent declaration that after Feb. 29 they will switch to a new torrent system, using so-called magnet links, in which nothing is downloaded from the site itself, The Guardian reported. \u201cNot having torrents will be a bit cheaper for us but it will also make it harder for our common enemies to stop us,\u201d the group said on Facebook. In 2010, a Swedish court ruled that the site abetted copyright infringement and ordered three of its founders to pay a $6.5 million fine.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Digital Notes: Pirate Bay Vows to Push On, Despite British Ruling", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Copyrights and Copyright Violations", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Decisions and Verdicts", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Pirate Bay", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Shazam Entertainment", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Great Britain", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2012-02-21T22:26:51+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Ben Sisario", "person": [{"firstname": "Ben", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Sisario", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/bd3a456d-f087-508b-b629-5fa624a8a246", "word_count": 291, "uri": "nyt://article/bd3a456d-f087-508b-b629-5fa624a8a246"}
