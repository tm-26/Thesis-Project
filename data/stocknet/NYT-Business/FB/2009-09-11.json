His story had the kind of arc that few writers can conjure. After a huge rise and fall in Hollywood as a producer that was accompanied by far too many substances, Mr. Dunne eventually sobered up, only to be confronted by the most unfathomable tragedy anyone can face: the murder of his daughter. After chronicling the trial for Vanity Fair, his second act was unstoppable, yielding books, magazines and an endless list of famous and infamous friends that he doted on and traded gossip with. All of it was lovingly recorded by Mr. Dunne, a serial namedropper who was quick to embrace his own fame before anybody ever heard of Facebook. Friends would talk of his penchant for scrapbooking his own life, of putting photos and invitations between pages as if he himself did not believe his good fortune.
