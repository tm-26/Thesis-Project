But some friends may be a little more active and dominate the feed, crowding out acquaintances who post less, or who are not as close to you. Facebook allows its members to tinker with the mix. On the News Feed page, hover over a friend\u2019s name or update with the cursor until an Options link appears on the right side of the line. Click on the link to get the choice to see fewer (or even more) updates from this particular pal. For more ways to fiddle with the feed, click on the Options for News Feed link at the bottom of the page.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "7", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Tip of the Week: Seeing Less of Your Friends on Facebook", "kicker": "Q & A", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Facebook.com", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2008-12-31T23:25:54+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Technology", "subsection_name": "Personal Tech", "byline": {"original": "By J.D.
