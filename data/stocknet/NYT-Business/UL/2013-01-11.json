Close behind were \u201cArgo,\u201d about political captivity; \u201cAmour,\u201d a French-language film about aging and dying; and \u201cDjango Unchained,\u201d a tale of slavery and retribution. \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild,\u201d which chronicles a child\u2019s encounters with rising floodwaters in the bayou, and \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d about the murky pursuit of a national enemy, also received best picture nominations. As Michael Cieply and Brooks Barnes report, the shocker was a triple snub in the best director category: Kathryn Bigelow (\u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d), Ben Affleck (\u201cArgo\u201d) and Quentin Tarantino (\u201cDjango Unchained\u201d) were passed over despite widespread expectations that one or all of them would be nominated. Instead, the nominations went to Steven Spielberg (\u201cLincoln\u201d), Ang Lee (\u201cLife of Pi\u201d), Michael Haneke (\u201cAmour\u201d), David O. Russell (\u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d) and Benh Zeitlin (\u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild,\u201d his first film). In all, nine films received best picture nominations in a field that can include as many as 10 or as few as 5, depending on how voters from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences spread their hand.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: Oscar Nods, Music by Beats, and a Space Age Ad Promotion", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Academy Awards (Oscars)", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ADVERTISING AND MARKETING", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Movies", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Music", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "AFFLECK, BEN", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Bigelow, Kathryn", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Haneke, Michael", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Lee, Ang", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Reznor, Trent", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Rogers, Ian", "rank": 10, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Russell, David O", "rank": 11, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Spielberg, Steven", "rank": 12, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Tarantino, Quentin", "rank": 13, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Zeitlin, Benh", "rank": 14, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURE ARTS AND SCIENCES", "rank": 15, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Beats Electronics", "rank": 16, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Mog", "rank": 17, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Nine Inch Nails", "rank": 18, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Rhapsody.com", "rank": 19, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Spotify", "rank": 20, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Unilever NV", "rank": 21, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "XCOR Aerospace", "rank": 22, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Curacao", "rank": 23, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2013-01-11T13:00:30+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By The Editors", "person": [], "organization": "The Editors"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/e2e3d5d1-62da-5752-944d-c925b80abfff", "word_count": 564, "uri": "nyt://article/e2e3d5d1-62da-5752-944d-c925b80abfff"}
