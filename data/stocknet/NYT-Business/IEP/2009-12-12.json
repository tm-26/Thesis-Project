Icahn, the investor, agreed to buy most of Trump Entertainment Resorts\u2019 bank debt, pitting Mr. Icahn against a bondholders\u2019 reorganization plan for the casino operator. Mr. Icahn leads a group that will buy a secured loan from the Beal Bank, which is first in line among creditors, and agreed to back the lender\u2019s reorganization plan for Trump Entertainment, according to a statement Friday. Trump Entertainment\u2019s three casinos filed for bankruptcy protection for the third time in February, blaming a high debt load and falling revenue. The founder, Donald Trump, and his daughter, Ivanka, dropped Beal as a partner last month and backed a bondholder plan that would give him up to 10 percent of the reorganized company.
