It was just last year, in March 2007, when Mr. Icahn offered $22 a share for the company. The board found that offer inadequate, and Mr. Icahn started a proxy fight for board representation. He won, and became chairman, but never completed a takeover. Bloomberg reports his companies and funds paid $112.6 million, or $18.46 a share, for a 16 percent stake.
