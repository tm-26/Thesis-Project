Yahoo said Thursday that it appointed Frank J. Biondi Jr. and John H. Chapple to its board. Their appointment, which had been expected, follows an agreement last month under which Mr. Icahn ended a proxy fight to replace Yahoo\u2019s entire board in exchange for three seats on an expanded Yahoo board. Mr. Icahn was appointed earlier this month to Yahoo\u2019s 11-member board.
