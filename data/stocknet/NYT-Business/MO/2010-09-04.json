Concern about potential losses tied to buybacks of home loans \u201cis not based on fact,\u201d and reserves to protect the company against claims are adequate, the chief executive, Alan M. Bennett, said Thursday during a conference call about fiscal first-quarter earnings. The call included repeated queries about claims, which have totaled more than $680 million. H&R Block originated mortgages through January 2008, and some were sold to become part of mortgage-backed securities. The company\u2019s mortgage buyback liability \u201cremains within our reserved expectations, and we continue to view related reserves as adequate,\u201d the chief financial officer, Jeffrey T. Brown, said. H&R Block reported a loss from continuing operations of $127.6 million, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ending July 10, compared with $130.6 million, or 39 cents, in the same period last year. Its net loss narrowed to $130.7 million from $133.6 million. Shares of H&R Block, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., rose 73 cents, or 6 percent, to $13.30.
