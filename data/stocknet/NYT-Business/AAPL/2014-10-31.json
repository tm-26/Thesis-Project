On Thursday, the bank startled investors with an announcement that it had to lower its third-quarter profit by $600 million because of \u201crapidly evolving regulatory inquiries and investigations,\u201d DealBook\u2019s Michael Corkery, Peter Eavis and Ben Protess write. Citigroup reported its results for the quarter two weeks ago, just before the legal development arose. Although the bank did not specify the development, people briefed on the matter attributed the nearly 18 percent drop in earnings to an investigation into whether Citigroup manipulated the price of foreign currencies. Since reporting its third-quarter results, the bank has edged nearer a settlement with at least one regulator in the case, the people said.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Morning Agenda: Citigroup\u2019s About-Face", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2014-10-31T12:19:49+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Sydney Ember", "person": [{"firstname": "Sydney", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Ember", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/b9878234-9774-5644-906a-533f148092ff", "word_count": 2415, "uri": "nyt://article/b9878234-9774-5644-906a-533f148092ff"}
