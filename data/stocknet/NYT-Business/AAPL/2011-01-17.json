Mr. Jobs, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is handing day-to-day control to the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Tim Cook, because of health issues. Yet he retains his chief executive title. This is the third such move, and this time the handover is indefinite. However painful, a more formal transfer to an acting chief executive would have been better.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2011/01/18/business/Views/Views-jumbo.jpg", "height": 804, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Apple Needs a Stronger Transfer of Power", "kicker": "Reuters Breakingviews", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Stronger Transfer Needed at Apple", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Yuan (Currency)", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Apple Inc", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Cook, Timothy D", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Jobs, Steven P", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-01-17T23:47:15+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Robert Cyran and John Foley", "person": [{"firstname": "Robert", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Cyran", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}, {"firstname": "John", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Foley", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 2}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/840b1280-73b2-5592-afd1-1bdedc9dbc06", "word_count": 685, "uri": "nyt://article/840b1280-73b2-5592-afd1-1bdedc9dbc06"}
