You can save paper by going to Word\u2019s Print Preview in the File menu and clicking the \u201cShrink to Fit\u201d or \u201cShrink One Page\u201d button, which has an icon showing multiple pages transforming onto one page. Word will automatically fiddle with the document\u2019s text size and spacing to get it all on a single page. But if the shrinkage messes up your formatting or looks too cramped, undo it by pressing Control-Z (Command-Z on a Mac), which reverses the process.
