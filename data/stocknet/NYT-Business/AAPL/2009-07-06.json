Jobs.", "lead_paragraph": "My friend and fellow New York Times columnist David Carr had a piece this morning arguing that there is really no need for Apple or the company\u2019s board to disclose information about the health of its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, because we already know everything we need to know to make an informed decision about Apple\u2019s stock. Mr. Jobs has had cancer, a disease where, as Mr. Carr puts it, \u201cthe prognosis is always unknowable.\u201d Then, a few months ago, while taking a leave of absence related to his health, Mr. Jobs had a liver transplant. Mr. Carr also points out \u2014 touch\u00e9 \u2014 that for all the talk about Mr. Jobs\u2019s indispensability, Apple\u2019s stock rose $50 a share while he was gone.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Apple and Disclosure: One More Time", "kicker": "Executive Suite", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-07-06T21:00:32+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Joe Nocera", "person": [{"firstname": "Joe", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Nocera", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "", "_id": "nyt://article/9a58e25c-b451-578d-bcc4-0dd9d2c29b41", "word_count": 547, "uri": "nyt://article/9a58e25c-b451-578d-bcc4-0dd9d2c29b41"}
