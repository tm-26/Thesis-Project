The approval, by Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton of Federal District Court in Oakland, Calif., became public on Friday and mirrored the speed with which a similar request regarding the Swiss bank giant UBS was approved, by a different judge, in 2008. That request was later dropped when UBS disclosed 4,450 American client names, a watershed in Swiss bank secrecy. Investigators suspect that HSBC, which is based in London solicited Indian-American clients through representatives\u2019 offices in New York and Fremont, Calif.
