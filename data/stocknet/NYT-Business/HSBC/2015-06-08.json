The company is expected to show new and improved versions of OS X, its Mac operating system, and iOS, the mobile software system powering iPhones and iPads. The company will also introduce a new streaming music service that it developed with Beats Electronics, the company it acquired last year for $3 billion. Absent from the unveilings will be a long-anticipated upgrade for the Apple TV set-top box, which was pulled from the conference because of issues related to content and technology. \u2014Brian X.
