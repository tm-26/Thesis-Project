The vaccine, called rindopepimut, is \u201cno longer a strategic priority of Pfizer,\u201d which will return the rights to the therapy to Celldex on Nov. 1, Celldex said. The treatment is in the second of three stages of testing generally required to win regulatory approval. Pfizer licensed rights to the product in 2008 from Celldex for as much as $440 million, plus royalties. If approved, the brain cancer vaccine could have $450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in 2013, Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital, said in May. Celldex\u2019s chief executive, Anthony Marucci, said the company would need to raise more money to pay for late-stage testing but would not need another partner. Shares of Celldex, based in Needham Mass., fell $1.25, or 26 percent, to $3.53.
