I\u2019ve never had a chance to meet her but I hear she\u2019s a wild and crazy gal, by which I mean a former stand-up comic among other things. She writes for magazines (Games, TV Guide) and has written for TV (Designing Women) . She once won a motor home on Wheel of Fortune, and she now runs a business called Acme Naming where she uses her word skills to sell names. She\u2019s a Scrabble fanatic, and now and then she guest-blogs for Rex Parker.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Judging Comedy Basics", "kicker": "Wordplay", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-01-04T23:00:20+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Crosswords & Games", "byline": {"original": "By Jim Horne", "person": [{"firstname": "Jim", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Horne", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/5fb2ff34-da9a-5a49-b1ad-04d79d6ebf4a", "word_count": 326, "uri": "nyt://article/5fb2ff34-da9a-5a49-b1ad-04d79d6ebf4a"}
