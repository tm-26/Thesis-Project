The accord \u201cwill allow Exxon Mobil to develop this very large, but technically challenging, resource as quickly as possible using a phased approach,\u201d Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for Exxon, said in an e-mail. Exxon sued on Aug. 12 over a ruling by the department that canceled Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia unit. The company and the government entered into a settlement agreement on Dec. 30, according to a filing Friday in United States District Court in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Exxon said in its complaint that it sought a suspension for its Julia leases in 2008 because of drilling complexity. It cited federal regulations that allow oil oil producers to suspend production in their fields, partly \u201cto facilitate proper development of a lease.\u201d The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating that the company\u201chad not demonstrated a commitment to production\u201d according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals followed.
