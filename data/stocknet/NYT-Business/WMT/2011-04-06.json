We turn the world\u2019s waste into new products. We collect non-recyclable waste, some straight from manufacturers and some from schools, charities and other community groups, and we partner with other manufacturers to recycle or \u201cupcycle\u201d that material into new products \u2014 like plastic lumber from juice pouches and shower curtains from sewn-together granola wrappers.
