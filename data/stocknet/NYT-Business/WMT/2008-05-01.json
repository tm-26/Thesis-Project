Net income climbed 15 percent, to 62 million Canadian dollars ($61.2 million), or 23 cents a share, from 54 million Canadian dollars, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier, when it recorded costs for cutting jobs. Sales rose 2.8 percent, to 6.53 billion Canadian dollars. The executive chairman, Galen G. Weston, said price cuts would continue this year as Loblaw tries to blunt Wal-Mart\u2019s expansion into fresh foods across Canada.
