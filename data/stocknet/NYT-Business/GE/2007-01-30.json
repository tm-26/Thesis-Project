{"abstract": "SHOELESS IN RENO? Unisys plans to open its first Registered Traveler program kiosk at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport in mid-February. But it is unlikely that the program will initially offer shoe-scanning technology, said Larry Zmuda, the company\u2019s partner for homeland-security-related business. In an interview, Mr. Zmuda said the major concern for Unisys was ensuring the program\u2019s \u201cpredictability\u201d for members, who will undergo a federal background check and pay an annual fee to receive biometrically encoded I.D. cards and access to a special lane for expedited passage through the security checkpoint. Mr. Zmuda cited early snags with shoe-scanning technology being tested in Orlando by Verified Identity Pass, which already operates a Registered Traveler program called Clear at Orlando and four other airports. The Clear shoe-scanning technology, developed by General Electric Security, was intended to detect traces of explosives and suspicious metal, and to allow most travelers to pass through Clear lanes without having to remove their shoes. But the scanner rejected an unexpectedly high number of travelers\u2019 shoes in Orlando, requiring members to remove their shoes just as they would at regular checkpoints. Mr. Zmuda said Unisys, which plans to be operating in 6 to 10 airports within a year, will probably offer only a special lane for the I.D. cards in Reno while the company continues to study options that will provide more benefits. Steven Brill, the founder of Verified Identity, has said that not having to remove shoes is the biggest potential benefit sought by customers. But Mr. Zmuda said that \u201call of our survey data\u201d show that not having to remove laptops from cases is the biggest benefit sought by potential members.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/business/30memo.html", "snippet": "SHOELESS IN RENO?
