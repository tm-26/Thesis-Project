His Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate said on Monday that it might buy back an unlimited amount of both classes of shares, at up to a 10 percent premium over book value. Many investors like to copy what Mr. Buffett does, but stock repurchases are best left to the Oracle of Omaha. If shares of other companies were truly undervalued, Berkshire probably wouldn\u2019t be buying its own.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "How to Mimic Berkshire\u2019s Bet", "kicker": "Reuters Breakingviews", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "How to Mimic Berkshire\u2019s Bet", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Stocks and Bonds", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Life Insurance", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Berkshire Hathaway Inc", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Buffett, Warren E", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Insurance", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-09-27T01:21:34+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Agnes T.
