The deal would give the label and performer royalties for traditional radio play \u2014 something the music business has long fought for and never received. In return, the label agreed to accept a cut for online radio play (which does award royalties to performers and labels), giving Clear Channel at least some measure of predictability in online payments. Online play is a tiny part of Clear Channel\u2019s business but the company saw an opportunity to preemptively control costs.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: Warren Buffett Likes Newspapers, and Barbara Walters Apologizes", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "ADVERTISING AND MARKETING", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Music", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "News and News Media", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Newspapers", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Radio", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Bieber, Justin", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Buffett, Warren E", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Morgan, Piers", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Sillerman, Robert F X", "rank": 10, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Swift, Taylor", "rank": 11, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Wald, Jonathan", "rank": 12, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Walters, Barbara", "rank": 13, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Berkshire Hathaway Inc", "rank": 14, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Clear Channel Communications Inc", "rank": 15, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CNN", "rank": 16, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Columbia University", "rank": 17, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Lee Enterprises Inc", "rank": 18, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Media General Inc", "rank": 19, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Omaha World-Herald", "rank": 20, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "St Louis Post-Dispatch", "rank": 21, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2012-06-06T14:00:19+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By The Editors", "person": [], "organization": "The Editors"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/b2c0f0d2-5643-586c-abba-3c61c85fc316", "word_count": 529, "uri": "nyt://article/b2c0f0d2-5643-586c-abba-3c61c85fc316"}
