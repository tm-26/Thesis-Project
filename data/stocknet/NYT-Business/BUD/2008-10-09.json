The merger would create a network of 8,200 agencies in France with 40 billion euros ($54.6 billion) of shareholder equity and 480 billion euros of savings and deposits, according to a statement Wednesday from Caisse d\u2019Epargne. The bank would rank second to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole by number of branches and have combined revenue of 17.5 billion euros. French officials have encouraged the merger in order to bolster capital and restore confidence among depositors and shareholders of Natixis as the global credit crisis worsens.
