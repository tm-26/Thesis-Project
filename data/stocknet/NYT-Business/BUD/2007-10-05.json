In a widely publicized move in July, Labatt Breweries of Canada summoned police after six Stella Artois bottles sold at restaurants and bars were found to contain concentrated alcohol rather than beer. No one was seriously injured. After a lengthy investigation with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the brewery, which like Stella Artois is a unit of the Belgian company InBev, said that the bottles were promotional items, intended for display. Alexis Redmond, a Labatt spokeswoman, said the bottles were filled with alcohol to avoid the formation of unsightly sediment. The company said that it had removed all such bottles across Canada.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "11", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Canada: Ad Campaign Gone Awry", "kicker": "World Business Briefing", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Canada: Ad Campaign Gone Awry", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "InBev", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Canada", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ADVERTISING AND MARKETING", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Beer", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2007-10-05T04:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "World Business", "byline": {"original": "By Ian Austen", "person": [{"firstname": "Ian", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Austen", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Brief", "_id": "nyt://article/eb46e76d-0549-588e-ba5a-7dce52291991", "word_count": 123, "uri": "nyt://article/eb46e76d-0549-588e-ba5a-7dce52291991"}
