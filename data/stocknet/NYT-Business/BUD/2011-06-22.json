The company\u2019s shareholders were unimpressed with quarterly numbers Tuesday that revealed a 17 percent jump in noncompensation expenses since February. Its stock tumbled more than 3 percent before regaining ground. But investors in other banks should worry more about the 30 percent fixed-income revenue decline at Jefferies since the previous quarter.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2011/06/22/business/VIEWS/VIEWS-jumbo.jpg", "height": 973, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Jefferies\u2019s Shadow on Wall Street", "kicker": "Reuters BreakingViews", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Jefferies\u2019s Shadow on Wall Street", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Banking and Financial Institutions", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Stocks and Bonds", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Jefferies Group Inc", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SABMiller", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Anheuser-Busch InBev N.V", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-06-22T01:15:55+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By ANTONY CURRIE and JOHN FOLEY", "person": [{"firstname": "Antony", "middlename": null, "lastname": "CURRIE", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}, {"firstname": "John", "middlename": null, "lastname": "FOLEY", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 2}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/ad9bd315-4ded-53a9-816e-3e1478478dd7", "word_count": 771, "uri": "nyt://article/ad9bd315-4ded-53a9-816e-3e1478478dd7"}
