John W. Rowe, the utility\u2019s chief executive, said Exelon was leaving because of the chamber\u2019s \u201cstridency against carbon legislation.\u201d The chamber has recently opposed an Environmental Protection Agency proposal to use the Clear Air Act to set limits on greenhouse gases. In addition, chamber officials have been quoted calling for a \u201cScopes monkey trial\u201d about the science of climate change. The chamber, which recently clarified its position on climate policy, says it is concerned that measures intended to address global warming will raise costs for business.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Is the Chamber of Commerce Right About Climate Change?", "kicker": "You&#039;re the Boss", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-10-05T19:56:39+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Entrepreneurship", "byline": {"original": "By The New York Times", "person": [], "organization": "The New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "", "_id": "nyt://article/4ace8f84-dd0a-5175-acf7-86dc31d10be2", "word_count": 145, "uri": "nyt://article/4ace8f84-dd0a-5175-acf7-86dc31d10be2"}
