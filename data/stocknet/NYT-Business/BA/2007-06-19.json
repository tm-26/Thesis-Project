In its annual forecast, Boeing said that 28,600 new commercial airplanes would be delivered in the next 20 years, when a total of 36,400 airliners would be flying the global skies. \u201cOver the next 20 years, the center of gravity of the world airline fleet will move substantially toward the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Boeing said in a report issued before the Paris air show this week. More than a third of the aircraft will be delivered to Asia-Pacific airlines, compared with about a quarter for North America. Within 20 years, the domestic market in China alone will increase to more than half the size of the domestic United States market, from its current one-fifth of the United States market, Boeing said. The company has been outpacing its rival Airbus in selling wide-body and other long-haul jets, including the 787, which is scheduled for initial deliveries next year.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "6", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Memo Pad", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Memo Pad", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Red Square", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOTELS AND MOTELS", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Travel and Vacations", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRPORTS", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Paris Air Show", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2007-06-19T04:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Joe Sharkey", "person": [{"firstname": "Joe", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Sharkey", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "List", "_id": "nyt://article/21abac98-7433-51e1-96d2-98293a9193a5", "word_count": 708, "uri": "nyt://article/21abac98-7433-51e1-96d2-98293a9193a5"}
