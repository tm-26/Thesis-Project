The companies were the only bidders in the latest phase of a decadelong effort to begin replacing the aging, white-topped helicopters that alight from the White House lawn. An earlier program run by Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland of Italy collapsed in 2009 because of technical difficulties and billions of dollars in cost overruns, with President Obama complaining that it was \u201can example of the procurement process gone amok.\u201d Industry officials said that AgustaWestland, Boeing and Bell Helicopter did not bid this time because they believed that the specifications favored a version of Sikorsky\u2019s S-92 helicopter, which is smaller than most of its rivals. The new contract will cover the development of six aircraft. The Navy, which runs the program, is likely to eventually buy 21 helicopters. Sikorsky, which built the current presidential helicopters, is a unit of United Technologies. It will assemble the new aircraft in Stratford, Conn. Lockheed will install the mission systems in Owego, N.Y.
