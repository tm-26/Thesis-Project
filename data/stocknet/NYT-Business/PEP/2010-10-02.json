The group, Arms Wide Open Childhood Cancer Foundation, raises money for alternative therapies and treatments for children with neuroblastoma. The group contended that 16 contestant-groups that were members of the Progressive Slate were political groups tied to the Democratic party and thus violated contest rules. Pepsi disagreed, saying the groups were not advocating for a particular candidate or issue. Eight of those groups won $50,000 prizes.
