This week, as part of a series of posts commemorating the 100th anniversary of Mr. Gardner\u2019s birth (see prior posts here and here), we feature one such student-turned-mathematician: best-selling author and mathematician Ian Stewart. In addition to being a remarkably productive university professor and researcher, Dr. Stewart took on what Mr. Gardner was most famous for: writing a popular math column for Scientific American. Dr. Stewart\u2019s Mathematical Recreations column ran for a full decade, covering topics as diverse as kissing numbers, elegant tiling and origami."", ""source"": ""The New York Times"", ""multimedia"": [{""rank"": 0, ""subtype"": ""xlarge"", ""caption"": null, ""credit"": null, ""type"": ""image"", ""url"": ""images/2014/10/25/crosswords/McLennan_Gardner100/McLennan_Gardner100-articleLarge.jpg"", ""height"": 807, ""width"": 600, ""subType"": ""xlarge"", ""crop_name"": ""articleLarge"", ""legacy"": {""xlarge"": ""images/2014/10/25/crosswords/McLennan_Gardner100/McLennan_Gardner100-articleLarge.jpg"", ""xlargewidth"": 600, ""xlargeheight"": 807}}, {""rank"": 0, ""subtype"": ""jumbo"", ""caption"": null, ""credit"": null, ""type"": ""image"", ""url"": ""images/2014/10/25/crosswords/McLennan_Gardner100/McLennan_Gardner100-jumbo.jpg"", ""height"": 839, ""width"": 624, ""subType"": ""jumbo"", ""crop_name"": ""jumbo"", ""legacy"": {}}, {""rank"": 0, ""subtype"": ""superJumbo"", ""caption"": null, ""credit"": null, ""type"": ""image"", ""url"": ""images/2014/10/25/crosswords/McLennan_Gardner100/McLennan_Gardner100-superJumbo.jpg"", ""height"": 839, ""width"": 624, ""subType"": ""superJumbo"", ""crop_name"": ""superJumbo"", ""legacy"": {}}, {""rank"": 0, ""subtype"": ""thumbnail"", ""caption"": null, ""credit"": null, ""type"": ""image"", ""url"": ""images/2014/10/25/crosswords/McLennan_Gardner100/McLennan_Gardner100-thumbStandard.jpg"", ""height"": 75, ""width"": 75, ""subType"": ""thumbnail"", ""crop_name"": ""thumbStandard"", ""legacy"": {""thumbnail"": ""images/2014/10/25/crosswords/McLennan_Gardner100/McLennan_Gardner100-thumbStandard.jpg"", ""thumbnailwidth"": 75, ""thumbnailheight"": 75}}, {""rank"": 0, ""subtype"": ""thumbLarge"", ""caption"": null, ""credit"": null, ""type"": ""image"", ""url"": ""images/2014/10/25/crosswords/McLennan_Gardner100/McLennan_Gardner100-thumbLarge.jpg"", ""height"": 150, ""width"": 150, ""subType"": ""thumbLarge"", ""crop_name"": ""thumbLarge"", ""legacy"": {}}], ""headline"": {""main"": ""Ignited by Martin Gardner, Ian Stewart Continues to Illuminate"", ""kicker"": ""Wordplay"", ""content_kicker"": null, ""print_headline"": """", ""name"": null, ""seo"": null, ""sub"": null}, ""keywords"": [{""name"": ""subject"", ""value"": ""Mathematics"", ""rank"": 3, ""major"": ""N""}, {""name"": ""subject"", ""value"": ""Puzzles"", ""rank"": 4, ""major"": ""N""}, {""name"": ""subject"", ""value"": ""Writing and Writers"", ""rank"": 5, ""major"": ""N""}, {""name"": ""persons"", ""value"": ""Gardner, Martin (1914-2010)"", ""rank"": 6, ""major"": ""N""}, {""name"": ""persons"", ""value"": ""Stewart, Ian"", ""rank"": 7, ""major"": ""N""}, {""name"": ""organizations"", ""value"": ""Cambridge University"", ""rank"": 8, ""major"": ""N""}, {""name"": ""organizations"", ""value"": ""Scientific American"", ""rank"": 9, ""major"": ""N""}], ""pub_date"": ""2014-10-27T16:00:01+0000"", ""document_type"": ""article"", ""news_desk"": ""Business"", ""section_name"": ""Crosswords & Games"", ""byline"": {""original"": ""By Gary Antonick"", ""person"": [{""firstname"": ""Gary"", ""middlename"": null, ""lastname"": ""Antonick"", ""qualifier"": null, ""title"": null, ""role"": ""reported"", ""organization"": """", ""rank"": 1}], ""organization"": null}, ""type_of_material"": ""News"", ""_id"": ""nyt://article/7a90dbd1-a4a5-5a36-b3c5-680dede58f2f"", ""word_count"": 3794, ""uri"": ""nyt://article/7a90dbd1-a4a5-5a36-b3c5-680dede58f2f""}"
