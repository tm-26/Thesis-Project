The executive, Robert Chapek, formerly president of distribution for Walt Disney Studios, will take over as president of Disney Consumer Products, succeeding Andrew P. Mooney, who resigned as chairman of that division on Tuesday. Mr. Chapek\u2019s first assignment will involve working with Disney\u2019s various units to create a more consolidated way of interacting with retailers like Wal-Mart. Disney currently handles merchandising in a decentralized fashion. The company\u2019s movie studio controls DVD sales. Disney Consumer Products manages apparel, toys and publishing. Another group oversees packaged video games. That means three different Disney teams typically interface with Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers. Disney\u2019s goal is to increase efficiency by having one point of contact.
