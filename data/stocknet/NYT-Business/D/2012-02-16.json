In his suit, filed this week in United States District Court in Nashville, Tenn., Mr. Rogers says that Capitol Records owes him more than $400,000, accusing the label of incorrectly counting downloads as \u201csales\u201d instead of as \u201clicenses,\u201d which pay a higher rate. The suit goes into a fair amount of detail about Mr. Rogers\u2019s account, saying that Capitol, an EMI division, also owes him at least $2,518.77 for record club sales and $10,880.18 in video costs, as well as unknown amounts from settlements in industry lawsuits against file-sharing services like Napster, Kazaa and Grokster.
