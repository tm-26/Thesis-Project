{"abstract": "The Agricultural Bank of China, saddled with $100 billion of bad loans, may move some of its 14,500 rural branches to independent companies to speed up a government bailout and sell shares for the first time. The bank, one of the nation\u2019s largest, was established in 1979 to serve China\u2019s 800 million farmers. The Ministry of Finance and the China Investment Company, an agency set up last month to manage $200 billion of the nation\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, would each own a third of Agricultural Bank, according to a draft of a government proposal obtained by Bloomberg News. Another 20 percent would be sold to foreign investors that have experience with rural lending, and about 5 percent to local corporate investors, according to the document. The remainder would be offered to the public. China has spent about $500 billion bailing out its biggest lenders over the past decade.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/11/business/worldbusiness/11fobriefs-china.html", "snippet": "The Agricultural Bank of China, saddled with $100 billion of bad loans, may move some of its 14,500 rural branches to independent companies to speed up a government bailout and sell shares for the first time.
