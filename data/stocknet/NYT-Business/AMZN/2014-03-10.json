My business partner Tyler Gage and I went to Ecuador and other parts of South America when we were in college, and after taking an entrepreneurship class we started our beverage company, Runa. We work with more than 2,000 guayusa growers who are all members of the Amazonian Kichwa indigenous group. They call themselves Runa, which translates to \u201cfully alive human being.\u201d Guayusa is a caffeinated tree leaf, and we sell it and use it to make our bottled beverages.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "6", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 544, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 544}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-jumbo.jpg", "height": 928, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1234, "width": 1361, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Fruitful but Tough Adventures in the Amazon", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Fruitful but Tough Adventures in the Amazon", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Business Travel", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Ecuador", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "AMAZON JUNGLE", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Runa LLC", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2014-03-10T22:13:01+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "International Business", "byline": {"original": "By Dan MacCombie", "person": [{"firstname": "Dan", "middlename": null, "lastname": "MacCombie", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/68a15705-45f0-52a8-ad9d-95d8b19e4ec9", "word_count": 613, "uri": "nyt://article/68a15705-45f0-52a8-ad9d-95d8b19e4ec9"}
