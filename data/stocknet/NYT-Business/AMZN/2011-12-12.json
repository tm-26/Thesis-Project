Last week, the implicit seemingly became explicit when Amazon began a promotion that encouraged customers to check out prices at local retailers and use a specially designed \u201cPrice Check\u201d smartphone app to report what they found back to Amazon. Customers who then purchased the same item from Amazon received a 5 percent discount, up to $5. (The deal was available only from Friday night through Saturday, and only for certain kinds of products.)", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Amazon Denies It Has a Small-Business Problem", "kicker": "You&#039;re the Boss", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Sales and Excise Taxes", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Shopping and Retail", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Small Business", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Snowe, Olympia", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-12-12T16:00:20+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Entrepreneurship", "byline": {"original": "By Robb Mandelbaum", "person": [{"firstname": "Robb", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Mandelbaum", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/2b7e4ebd-7bf8-5da7-a905-8aae102abd0c", "word_count": 764, "uri": "nyt://article/2b7e4ebd-7bf8-5da7-a905-8aae102abd0c"}
