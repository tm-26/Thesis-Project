Barack Obama may have earned record-breaking ratings for his acceptance speech on Thursday, the final night of the Democratic National Convention, but network television attracted otherwise tiny audiences during prime time. According to Nielsen\u2019s final ratings, CBS led the night with \u201cBig Brother,\u201d which drew 6 million viewers at 8 p.m., the night\u2019s largest audience prior to the 10 p.m. convention coverage. CBS broadcast a rerun of \u201cCSI\u201d at 9 p.m. (5.3 million). Fox ranked runner up on the night with two special episodes of its honesty-testing game show \u201cThe Moment of Truth\u201d at 8 p.m. (3.7 million) and 9 p.m. (5.2 million).
