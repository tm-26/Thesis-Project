{"abstract": "CBS ranked runner up in the ratings for the fifth consecutive night on Thursday, trailing far behind NBC\u2019s ongoing coverage of the Olympics but earning modest audiences for \u201cBig Brother\u201d and \u201cFlashpoint.\u201d According to Nielsen\u2019s estimates, the two CBS series delivered 6.7 million and 6.3 million viewers, respectively, at 8 and 10 p.m. In between, CBS broadcast a rerun of \u201cCSI\u201d at 9 p.m. (6.1 million). Meanwhile, the Summer Games attracted an average of 28 million viewers for NBC during prime time, slightly more than Wednesday night\u2019s final tally of 27.7 million from 8 to 11:26 p.m. The audience peaked on Thursday during the 10 p.m. time slot, during which the network captured Michael Phelps winning his sixth Beijing gold medal and the 12th of his career. Nearly 35 million viewers were tuned in to NBC that hour. Fox third for the night with ABC close behind in fourth. Both networks averaged well under 4 million viewers. Fox\u2019s pre-season football coverage was interrupted for an hour due to severe weather, making precise audience figures unavailable until final ratings are released later today.
