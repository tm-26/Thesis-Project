{"abstract": "Strong ratings for the new whodunit crime show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Mentalist\u00e2\u20ac\u009d helped CBS eke out a slight victory on Tuesday as the most watched network despite day two of ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings juggernaut \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dancing With the Stars.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d According to Nielsen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimates, the new 9 p.m. drama, with Australian actor Simon Baker in the lead role, attracted 15.5 million viewers, nearly 5 million better than CBS\u2019s premiere of \u201cThe Unit\u201d in the same time period a year ago. \u201cThe Mentalist\u201d made its debut in a plum time slot wedged between CBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153NCIS\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at 8 p.m., which garnered its largest premiere audience in its six seasons (17.7 million), and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without a Trace\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at 10 p.m. (11.4 million). Among adults 18 to 49, however, CBS ranked third behind second place ABC with its two-hour block of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dancing With the Stars\u00e2\u20ac\u009d from 9 to 11 p.m. (18.2 million) and Fox, which led the night in that age group despite lagging in third in total viewers. Fox broadcast \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at 8 p.m. (12.1 million) and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fringe\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at 9 p.m. (9.7 million). ABC would have won the night outright had it not trailed badly during the 8 p.m. hour with the debut of its new family game show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Opportunity Knocks\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (6.6 million). NBC finished fourth, drawing 7.2 million for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Biggest Loser\u00e2\u20ac\u009d from 8 to 10 p.m. followed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in the 10 p.m. time slot (9.5 million). NBC nearly tied CBS for third place in the 18-to-49 set. Finally, the CW, in fifth place as usual, earned 3 million viewers for \u201c90210\u201d at 8 p.m. but just 1.9 million for \u201cPrivileged\u201d at 9 p.m.", "web_url": "https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/ratings-the-mentalist-boosts-cbs-but-then-a-real-mentalist-would-already-know-that/", "snippet": "Strong ratings for the new whodunit crime show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Mentalist\u00e2\u20ac\u009d helped CBS eke out a slight victory on Tuesday as the most watched network despite day two of ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings juggernaut \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dancing With the Stars.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d According to Nielsen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s esti...", "lead_paragraph": "Strong ratings for the new whodunit crime show \u201cThe Mentalist\u201d helped CBS eke out a slight victory on Tuesday as the most-watched network despite Day 2 of ABC\u2019s ratings juggernaut \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d According to Nielsen\u2019s estimates, the new 9 p.m. drama, with the Australian actor Simon Baker in the lead role, attracted 15.5 million viewers, nearly 5 million better than CBS\u2019s premiere of \u201cThe Unit\u201d in the same time period a year ago.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Ratings: \u2018The Mentalist\u2019 Lifts CBS, but Then a Real Mentalist Would Already Know That", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-09-24T18:26:08+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Media", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Benjamin Toff", "person": [{"firstname": "Benjamin", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Toff", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/38cc97c5-f2cb-54b4-9ff6-80a3f5068a97", "word_count": 270, "uri": "nyt://article/38cc97c5-f2cb-54b4-9ff6-80a3f5068a97"}
