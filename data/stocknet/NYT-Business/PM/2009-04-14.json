The actual total, they say, is $28 billion, and Goldman has the right to raise that as high as $35 billion. I have also updated the post to reflect the closing price of Goldman stock today.Goldman Sachs, as you know by now, wants to return that $10 billion in TARP money it got.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "What About That Other $28 Billion?", "kicker": "Economix", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-04-14T19:22:19+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Economy", "byline": {"original": "By Floyd Norris", "person": [{"firstname": "Floyd", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Norris", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/5778dc6e-8cd9-51bb-9af3-17f353a86bb2", "word_count": 303, "uri": "nyt://article/5778dc6e-8cd9-51bb-9af3-17f353a86bb2"}
