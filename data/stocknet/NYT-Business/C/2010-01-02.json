The accident, in which she was struck and killed by a car, happened while she was on a long-planned trip with her husband, C. Peter Magrath, the former president of the University of Minnesota. She was 68 at the time of her death, and while tragic, the fact that she died in the midst of one more adventure on a life-list full of them surprised no one who knew her.
