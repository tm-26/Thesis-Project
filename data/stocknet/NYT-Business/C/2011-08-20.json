Goldfarb, to three years in prison for his role in an insider trading scheme that involved a hedge fund trader and two corporate lawyers. Mr. Goldfarb, who worked at Brecher Fishman Pasternack Walsh Tilker & Ziegler, pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme with Zvi Goffer, a former trader at the Galleon Group, the hedge fund run by Raj Rajaratnam. He admitted to receiving tips about impending corporate mergers from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, two low-level associates at the law firm Ropes & Gray, and then passing them to Mr. Goffer. During an April court appearance, Mr. Goldfarb, who earned college and law degrees from Villanova, said that Mr. Goffer, a friend, approached him shortly after his law school graduation and asked if he knew any corporate lawyers. Mr. Goldfarb said he eventually introduced Mr. Goffer to Mr. Cutillo, his college roommate. Both Mr. Cutillo and Mr. Santarlas have pleaded guilty to leaking information about takeovers involving 3Com and Axcan Pharma. Mr. Goffer took his case to trial and was convicted by a jury in June.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Lawyer Sentenced in Insider Trading Case", "kicker": "Business Briefing | Legal News", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Lawyer Sentenced in Insider Trading Case", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Rajaratnam, Raj", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Insider Trading", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-08-20T01:08:29+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Peter Lattman", "person": [{"firstname": "Peter", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Lattman", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Brief", "_id": "nyt://article/6ce8ca94-6b8e-5ce9-9603-cfe8bc91023d", "word_count": 187, "uri": "nyt://article/6ce8ca94-6b8e-5ce9-9603-cfe8bc91023d"}
