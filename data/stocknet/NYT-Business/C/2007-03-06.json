The cash offer is part of a broader effort at Citigroup to reengineer its business in Japan, which is the world\u2019s second-largest economy but accounts for a relatively small part of Citi\u2019s business. Citi has suffered some setbacks in Japan in recent years, including the shutdown of its private bank there, which regulators ordered to close in 2004.
