He was a top-ranked telecommunications research analyst on Wall Street in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, he settled a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission over accusations that his work for investment banking clients led him to publish misleading research reports on companies that his employer, Citigroup, advised. As part of the settlement, in which Mr. Grubman did not admit or deny the allegations, he was barred from the securities industry. Mr. Grubman has no role either as an adviser or an investor in any of the companies discussed in this essay. This is his first public commentary since his settlement a decade ago.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Grubman: Dish/Sprint Numbers Don\u2019t Add Up to Shareholder Value", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Telephones and Telecommunications", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Grubman, Jack", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Softbank Corp", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Sprint Nextel Corporation", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2013-05-29T16:24:39+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Jack Grubman", "person": [{"firstname": "Jack", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Grubman", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/4106f3da-5cd3-52c7-93d8-f5352ccdfef1", "word_count": 943, "uri": "nyt://article/4106f3da-5cd3-52c7-93d8-f5352ccdfef1"}
