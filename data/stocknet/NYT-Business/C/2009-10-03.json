The drug, known as RP101, is a nucleoside analog that was being tested for patients with late-stage cancer of the pancreas, the company said. The decision to stop the study was based on a review of data by a safety monitoring group overseeing the trial, the company said. SciClone, based in Foster City, Calif., markets Zadaxin, a treatment for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and certain cancers. The RP101 study was in the second of three phases generally required by regulators before they will approve a drug. The company did not specify what the safety panel found.
