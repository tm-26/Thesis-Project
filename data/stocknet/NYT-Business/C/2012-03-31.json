The Scana Corporation plans to build the reactors at the Virgil C. Summer plant northwest of Columbia. The company plans to cover 55 percent of the project\u2019s estimated $10.2 billion cost, with Santee Cooper, South Carolina\u2019s largest power producer, paying the remainder. Based in Cayce, S.C., Scana, which submitted its application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in March 2008, said its first unit would not begin operating until 2017, about a year behind schedule, because of delays in the commission\u2019s licensing process. The second is expected to start running in 2018.
