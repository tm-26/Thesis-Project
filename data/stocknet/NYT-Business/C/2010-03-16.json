The amusement park operator Cedar Fair announced on Monday night that it had postponed Tuesday morning\u2019s meeting for unit holders to vote on the company\u2019s acquisition by Apollo Management, saying it wanted to provide more time to solicit votes and proxies. For those unit holders who have already made the trip up to Sandusky, Ohio, for the meeting, they will have a relatively long wait. The meeting is postponed until April 8. Perhaps Cedar Fair will placate these unit holders with some free amusement park tickets in the interim.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Cedar Fair\u2019s Last-Minute Change of Heart", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "AMUSEMENT AND THEME PARKS", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Private Equity", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Icahn, Carl C", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "APOLLO MANAGEMENT LP", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CF Industries Holdings Incorporated", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "LEAR CORP", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Neuberger Berman LLC", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Q Investments Limited", "rank": 10, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Six Flags Great Adventure", "rank": 11, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Terra Industries Incorporated", "rank": 12, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Yara International", "rank": 13, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2010-03-16T18:48:28+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Steven Davidoff Solomon", "person": [{"firstname": "Steven", "middlename": "Davidoff", "lastname": "Solomon", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "", "_id": "nyt://article/40c80196-b417-54bb-aae8-2665eae29393", "word_count": 1429, "uri": "nyt://article/40c80196-b417-54bb-aae8-2665eae29393"}
