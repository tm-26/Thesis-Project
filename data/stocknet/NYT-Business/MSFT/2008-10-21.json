For example, the phone companies are selling more smartphones at lower profit margins. On the other hand, Netflix is selling fewer new subscriptions at higher profit margins. You might even call the seeming reluctance of the Justice Department to okay Yahoo\u2019s deal to have Google sell some of its ads a mixed blessing, at least for Google. Now that Microsoft doesn\u2019t seem to want to buy Yahoo, a blocked deal could leave Yahoo, Google\u2019s biggest rival, to wither with no savior in sight.
