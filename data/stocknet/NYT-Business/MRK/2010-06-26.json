The jury in New York set damages at $8 million in the case of Shirley Boles, 72, of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., who said she developed osteonecrosis of the jaw by taking Fosamax. With osteonecrosis, a bone is no longer alive and cannot regenerate because of a lack of blood supply, according to the National Osteonecrosis Foundation\u2019s Web site. The first Fosamax case resulted in a Merck victory in May. United States District Judge John F. Keenan, who is overseeing federal Fosamax litigation, scheduled three bellwether trials that might point the way to out-of-court settlements and show each side the other\u2019s strategy. The third case is to be tried in November. \u201cWe believe the jury verdict was a result of plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s inflammatory and prejudicial remarks,\u201d Paul F. Strain, a lawyer for Merck, said in a statement.
