BP plans to drill its first Libyan well in the second half of 2010 as part of a $900 million exploration program, a company spokesman, David Nicholas, said on Monday. BP signed an accord with Libya\u2019s National Oil Corporation in May 2007, during a visit by Tony Blair, then the British prime minister. The deal has raised political questions after the Scottish government\u2019s Aug. 20 decision to free on compassionate grounds the terminally ill Mr. Ali, the only Libyan convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. BP\u2019s agreement allows it to explore 21,000 square miles and the company said in 2007 that it planned to drill 17 exploration wells and potentially as many as 20 more.
