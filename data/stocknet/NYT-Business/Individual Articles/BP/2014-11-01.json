I like a nice, relatively easy puzzle with a nice, relatively easy theme after a puzzle like yesterday\u2019s Trip Payne tour de force. No math symbols. No tricks. No rebuses. Like today\u2019s puzzle: a nice, well put-together letter-swap theme. And by Brendan Emmett Quigley, yet. That means lots of good pop culture.
