The bank earned $5.57 billion in the quarter, or $1.36 a share, compared with a loss of $380 million in the quarter a year earlier, when the bank booked $7.2 billion in legal costs. Net revenue rose 5 percent, to $25.2 billion, from the third quarter of 2013. The earnings fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.38 a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
