On Friday, 21st Century Fox offered to buy the 61 percent of Sky, the European pay-TV group, that it does not own. The proposal notionally values Sky at 18.5 billion pounds ($23 billion), though only about \u00a311.3 billion would change hands. Circumstances look a lot more auspicious than the last time Rupert Murdoch and his family tried to consolidate the business, in 2010.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Murdochs Take Another Shot at Sky", "kicker": "Breakingviews", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "21st Century Fox", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Fox Entertainment Group Inc", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AT&T Inc", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Time Warner Inc", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DirecTV", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "News Corporation", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Murdoch, James R", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Murdoch, Rupert", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2016-12-09T21:31:27+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "DealBook", "byline": {"original": "By Jennifer Saba and Fiona Maharg-Bravo", "person": [{"firstname": "Jennifer", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Saba", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}, {"firstname": "Fiona", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Maharg-Bravo", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 2}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/23ae7925-cf2f-56f6-a2fc-6ec8a1beb7e8", "word_count": 377, "uri": "nyt://article/23ae7925-cf2f-56f6-a2fc-6ec8a1beb7e8"}
