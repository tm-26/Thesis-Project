Jevic Holding Corp. on Wednesday. At issue is whether a bankruptcy court can approve a settlement that distributes the debtor\u2019s remaining assets in a way that could not be done under a Chapter 11 plan, at least not without the agreement of all creditors. In this case, some of the parties agreed to settle the case and to pay out the debtor\u2019s cash to some of the creditors, but they intentionally skipped a class of creditors who were entitled to priority payment under the bankruptcy code.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Deciding Who Should Get First Dibs in Bankruptcy Liquidations", "kicker": "In Debt", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Bankruptcies", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Suits and Litigation (Civil)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Supreme Court (US)", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Douglas, William O", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2016-12-06T19:22:03+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "DealBook", "byline": {"original": "By Stephen J.
