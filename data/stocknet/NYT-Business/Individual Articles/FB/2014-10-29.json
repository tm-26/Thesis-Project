Profit in the quarter had been expected to suffer after Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, said last week that it had set aside an additional 894 million euros, or about $1.1 billion, to cover legal costs. The loss provides another reminder that Deutsche Bank and other large investment banks are still preoccupied with dealing with the excesses associated with the financial crisis, as well as increasing demands from regulators intent on curbing risk-taking by banks.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Morning Agenda: Shake-Up at Deutsche Bank", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2014-10-29T11:44:38+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Sydney Ember", "person": [{"firstname": "Sydney", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Ember", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/79ec6ee0-cdba-519f-8c75-c2ebc7e6d0c7", "word_count": 2099, "uri": "nyt://article/79ec6ee0-cdba-519f-8c75-c2ebc7e6d0c7"}
