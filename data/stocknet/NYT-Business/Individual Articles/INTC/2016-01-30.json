Today, Mr. Bendavid presents us with a list of warnings to buyers that are clued in a punny way. Caveat emptor.

For some reason, \u201cNote on a watered-down assault indictment?\u201d for BATTERY NOT INCLUDED made me cringe a bit.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Message to Buyers", "kicker": "Wordplay", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Crossword Puzzles", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2016-01-30T23:00:11+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Crosswords & Games", "byline": {"original": "By Deb Amlen", "person": [{"firstname": "Deb", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Amlen", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/a4d9efba-1914-5a55-8ac2-1f29d915e8f6", "word_count": 390, "uri": "nyt://article/a4d9efba-1914-5a55-8ac2-1f29d915e8f6"}
