Ackman\u2019s defense of Valeant Pharmaceuticals was bold but unpersuasive. Mr. Ackman, who leads Pershing Square Capital, says that Valeant, a drug giant worth $34 billion, is a victim of bad public relations, na\u00efve investors and jealous rivals. He even compared his stake to one of the riskiest but most successful bets ever made by Warren E. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway chief. In reality, the company is flawed in ways that Mr. Ackman\u2019s pep talk won\u2019t fix.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/07/business/06db-ackman-copy/06db-ackman-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 392, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2015/08/07/business/06db-ackman-copy/06db-ackman-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 392}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/07/business/06db-ackman-copy/06db-ackman-jumbo.jpg", "height": 669, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/07/business/06db-ackman-copy/06db-ackman-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1338, "width": 2048, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/07/business/06db-ackman-copy/06db-ackman-copy-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2015/08/07/business/06db-ackman-copy/06db-ackman-copy-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/07/business/06db-ackman-copy/06db-ackman-copy-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Trying in Vain to Put a Positive Spin on Valeant\u2019s Troubles", "kicker": "Breakingviews", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Hedge Funds", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2015-10-30T22:22:59+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "DealBook", "byline": {"original": "By Robert Cyran", "person": [{"firstname": "Robert", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Cyran", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/6e8db7fa-a2a7-506e-94cd-2f732b549c48", "word_count": 429, "uri": "nyt://article/6e8db7fa-a2a7-506e-94cd-2f732b549c48"}
