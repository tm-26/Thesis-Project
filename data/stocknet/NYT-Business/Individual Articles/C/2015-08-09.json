That gap is where your brain takes all of the theme clues, digests them and then delivers that \u201cAha!\u201d moment that we all know and love. The gap can\u2019t be too short, because that would mean that the theme is too obvious, and that\u2019s no fun. It can\u2019t be too long, because then it wouldn\u2019t be a Monday puzzle. It\u2019s an art to get it just right.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Smile!", "kicker": "Wordplay", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Crossword Puzzles", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2015-08-09T22:00:25+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Crosswords & Games", "byline": {"original": "By Deb Amlen", "person": [{"firstname": "Deb", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Amlen", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/0a2fb793-1c43-506c-965e-c223e2492014", "word_count": 365, "uri": "nyt://article/0a2fb793-1c43-506c-965e-c223e2492014"}
