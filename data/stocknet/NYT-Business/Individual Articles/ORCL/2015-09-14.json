The move into the heart of Boeing\u2019s home turf is part of a long-term strategy by Airbus aimed at doubling its share of the American market for 150-seat airplanes, which is currently dominated by Boeing\u2019s top-selling 737. Airbus plans to build as many as 36 of its competing A320 and A321 models a year by 2018 and says the Mobile plant has the capacity to double that production. All of the aircraft produced at the site are destined for delivery to American carriers, which are expected to need as many as 4,700 new single-aisle planes over the next 20 years. \u2014Nicola Clark", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Fed\u2019s Decision on Interest Rates, Autoworkers\u2019 Contract Talks and a Greek Election", "kicker": "The Week Ahead", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "United States Economy", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Federal Reserve System", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Automobiles", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Detroit (Mich)", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Shopping and Retail", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Consumer Price Index", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Oracle Corporation", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Interest Rates", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Greece", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Elections", "rank": 10, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2015-09-14T00:43:34+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By The New York Times", "person": [], "organization": "The New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/eaa3d34e-7b22-5766-8db7-1661074db094", "word_count": 939, "uri": "nyt://article/eaa3d34e-7b22-5766-8db7-1661074db094"}
