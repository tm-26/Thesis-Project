Cohan writes in the Street Scene column.", "lead_paragraph": "For the last 25 years or so, Robert E. Rubin, a former co-senior partner at Goldman Sachs when it was a private partnership, has played an inordinately important role in Washington. Some of his extraordinary influence has been overt, as when he served President Clinton as head of the National Economic Council and then as Treasury secretary, and some of it has been subtler but no less significant. For instance, his fingerprints are all over the Obama administration\u2019s cabinet and its economic team: Timothy F. Geithner, Lawrence H. Summers, Peter R. Orszag, Gene B. Sperling, Jason Furman, Jacob J. Lew, Michael Froman and Sylvia Mathews Burwell at one time or another have had \u2014 or still have \u2014 close ties to Mr. Rubin.
