That same year, she co-founded a daily green-lifestyle email subscription service, Ideal Bite, sold four years later to Disney with 318,000 daily subscribers, for $20 million. Ms. Boulden remained with the venture, overseeing its growth to more than 500,000 daily subscribers until Disney shut it down in 2010. She then started JenB TV, a green lifestyle website on which she posts  advice weekly.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/11/19/business/energy-environment/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 902, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2014/11/19/business/energy-environment/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 902}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/11/19/business/energy-environment/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main-jumbo.jpg", "height": 1024, "width": 682, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/11/19/business/energy-environment/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 2048, "width": 1363, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/11/19/business/energy-environment/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2014/11/19/business/energy-environment/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/11/19/business/energy-environment/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main/19iht-rbog-qjen19-main-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "It\u2019s a Light Green Lifestyle", "kicker": "Q&A", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "It's a Light Green Lifestyle", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Media", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Entrepreneurship", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Ecology and Environment Inc", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Environment", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2014-11-18T14:27:17+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Energy & Environment ", "byline": {"original": "By Christopher F.
