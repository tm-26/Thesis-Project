Industry analysts project that year-over-year sales will drop slightly, but will still exceed 1.5 million vehicles for the month. So far this year, consumers have flooded vehicle showrooms to buy pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, while sales of passenger cars have declined. The trend has benefited the Detroit automakers, which are expected to report sales increases in August. Analysts do not expect the recent stock market fluctuations to have had much effect on the auto industry. \u2014Bill Vlasic", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/31/business/31AHEAD1/31AHEAD1-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 462, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2015/08/31/business/31AHEAD1/31AHEAD1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 462}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/31/business/31AHEAD1/31AHEAD1-jumbo.jpg", "height": 788, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/31/business/31AHEAD1/31AHEAD1-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1576, "width": 2048, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/31/business/31AHEAD1/31AHEAD1-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2015/08/31/business/31AHEAD1/31AHEAD1-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/08/31/business/31AHEAD1/31AHEAD1-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Car Sales, Samsung\u2019s New Smartwatch, and the Jobs Report", "kicker": "The Week Ahead", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Automobiles", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Samsung Electronics Co", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Wearable Computing", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "European Central Bank", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Walt Disney Company", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "United States Economy", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Labor and Jobs", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2015-08-31T00:32:04+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By The New York Times", "person": [], "organization": "The New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/3bddad75-e92d-5b26-9ebc-96fdf192ff0f", "word_count": 643, "uri": "nyt://article/3bddad75-e92d-5b26-9ebc-96fdf192ff0f"}
