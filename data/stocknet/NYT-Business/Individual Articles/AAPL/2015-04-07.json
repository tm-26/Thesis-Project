Adnan Syed.\u201d", "lead_paragraph": "The story behind the hit podcast \u201cSerial\u201d is not over. The podcast focused on the 1999 death of Hae Min Lee, a Maryland teenager, and the subsequent conviction of her former boyfriend, Adnan Syed, who is serving a life sentence for murder. It became the fastest podcast to reach five million downloads, according to Apple. Starting Monday a group of lawyers and advocates connected to Mr. Syed will debut another podcast, \u201cUndisclosed: The State v. Adnan Syed,\u201d which will \u201cexamine and explore the case in greater detail, from an investigatory perspective instead of a narrative one,\u201d according to a statement. \u201cUndisclosed\u201d is being presented by Rabia Chaudry, a lawyer who has been a longtime advocate of Mr. Syed \u2014 as \u201cSerial\u201d fans know, she was the one who suggested that Sarah Koenig, the host of \u201cSerial\u201d and a longtime producer for \u201cThis American Life,\u201d look into the case \u2014 along with two other lawyers, Susan Simpson and Colin Miller. None of them represent Mr. Syed but each has been investigating the case, Ms. Chaudry said in an interview Tuesday. New episodes of \u201cUndisclosed\u201d are to be released every two weeks. The podcast is sponsored by the Adnan Syed Legal Trust, which, according to a page on the crowdfunding site LaunchGood, is dedicated to Mr. Syed\u2019s defense and has raised $93,000. In November the producers of \u201cSerial\u201d said that a second season was coming. In February a Maryland court agreed to hear an appeal from Mr. Syed, who has said that he is not guilty of Ms. Lee\u2019s murder and that he received ineffective legal counsel at trial.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "3", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/01/22/opinion/22murray/22murray-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 492, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2015/01/22/opinion/22murray/22murray-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 492}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/01/22/opinion/22murray/22murray-jumbo.jpg", "height": 840, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/01/22/opinion/22murray/22murray-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1680, "width": 2048, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/01/22/opinion/22murray/22murray-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2015/01/22/opinion/22murray/22murray-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2015/01/22/opinion/22murray/22murray-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Another \u2018Serial\u2019 Chapter, From Group of Lawyers", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Another \u2018Serial\u2019 Chapter, From Group of Lawyers", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Television", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Podcasts", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Syed, Adnan", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Murders, Attempted Murders and Homicides", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Lee, Hae Min (1980-99)", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Maryland", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Serial (Radio Program)", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Undisclosed: The State v.
