But don\u2019t expect last week\u2019s agreement to set the first standards for airplanes to make a big dent. In fact, it will do little to reduce the rise in emissions from airlines, the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "4", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2016/02/16/business/16airlines2/16airlines2-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 379, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2016/02/16/business/16airlines2/16airlines2-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 379}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2016/02/16/business/16airlines2/16airlines2-jumbo.jpg", "height": 648, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2016/02/16/business/16airlines2/16airlines2-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1295, "width": 2048, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2016/02/16/business/16airlines2/16airlines2-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2016/02/16/business/16airlines2/16airlines2-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2016/02/16/business/16airlines2/16airlines2-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Deal on Aviation Emissions Sets Can\u2019t-Miss Goals", "kicker": "Itineraries", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Deal on Aviation Emissions Sets Can\u2019t-Miss Goals", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "International Civil Aviation Organization", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Global Warming", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Boeing Company", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AIRBUS INDUSTRIE", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fuel Emissions (Transportation)", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2016-02-15T17:24:37+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Energy & Environment ", "byline": {"original": "By Jad Mouawad", "person": [{"firstname": "Jad", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Mouawad", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/fea50f86-eac1-5f31-b30b-2b400b8884cf", "word_count": 713, "uri": "nyt://article/fea50f86-eac1-5f31-b30b-2b400b8884cf"}
