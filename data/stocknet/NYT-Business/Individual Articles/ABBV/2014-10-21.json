Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, has \u201ctalked a good game about focusing on \u2018shareholder value,\u2019\u201d Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook Column. Even Warren E. Buffett, who has long held an aversion to technology companies, has invested in IBM. But these \u201cshareholder friendly\u201d maneuvers have been masking an ugly truth. \u201cIBM\u2019s success in recent years has been tied more to financial engineering than actual performance,\u201d Mr. Sorkin writes. This became apparent on Monday morning when the company announced its earnings, missing analysts\u2019 expectations by a wide margin. The stock fell more than 7 percent, to $169.10, by the end of the day, below the average price Mr. Buffett paid since he started buying the stock in 2011.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Morning Agenda: IBM\u2019s Ugly Truth", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2014-10-21T11:42:27+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Sydney Ember", "person": [{"firstname": "Sydney", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Ember", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/3256425f-7d69-5326-9ae2-667fa69661fb", "word_count": 2399, "uri": "nyt://article/3256425f-7d69-5326-9ae2-667fa69661fb"}
