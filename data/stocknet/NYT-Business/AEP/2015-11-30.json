Try this experiment in clairvoyance with the late recreational mathematician, Martin Gardner.", "lead_paragraph": "Martin Gardner was a giant in the recreational math world \u2014 many of the puzzles we take on\u00a0each week here at Numberplay are direct descendants of the many counter-intuitive conundra\u00a0that Gardner curated\u00a0in the\u00a020th century. He was such a significant force in math puzzles that we forget \u2014 or have a hard time really believing \u2014 that he had other lives, including that of a popular and influential magician. This week I\u2019m pleased to present a book that captures this magical life: Martin Gardner\u2019s Impromptu. The book is absolutely gorgeous: beautifully designed and full of detail, with\u00a0hundreds of pages of original notes and sketches by Martin Gardner (the book itself is over 800 pages long). Click\u00a0here to enjoy selections from the color section of the book, and here for an introduction to MiniTrix, a series of short videos featuring Martin Gardner performing various impromptu tricks.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Martin Gardner\u2019s Impromptu", "kicker": "Wordplay", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Books and Literature", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Magic and Magicians", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mathematics", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Puzzles", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Carroll, Lewis", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Gardner, Martin (1914-2010)", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Scientific American", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2015-11-30T17:00:42+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Crosswords & Games", "byline": {"original": "By Gary Antonick", "person": [{"firstname": "Gary", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Antonick", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/b07353ba-3104-5d49-9768-4b3a9135ec8a", "word_count": 1107, "uri": "nyt://article/b07353ba-3104-5d49-9768-4b3a9135ec8a"}
