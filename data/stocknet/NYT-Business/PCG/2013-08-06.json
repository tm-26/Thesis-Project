Now, laser technology, some of it borrowed from the telecommunications industry, is giving engineers and scientists crucial new tools to measure leaks and track them to their source.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "3", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2013/08/07/business/Gas1/Gas1-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 474, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2013/08/07/business/Gas1/Gas1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 474}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2013/08/07/business/Gas1/Gas1-jumbo.jpg", "height": 808, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2013/08/07/business/Gas1/Gas1-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1022, "width": 1295, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2013/08/07/business/Gas1/Gas1-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2013/08/07/business/Gas1/Gas1-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2013/08/07/business/Gas1/Gas1-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "New Tools Pinpoint Natural Gas Leaks, Maximizing a Fuel\u2019s Green Qualities", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "New Tools Pinpoint Natural Gas Leaks, Maximizing a Fuel\u2019s Green Qualities", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Natural Gas", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Research", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Methane", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Picarro Inc", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Pacific Gas and Electric Co", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Boston (Mass)", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "California", "rank": 10, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2013-08-06T21:16:34+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Energy & Environment ", "byline": {"original": "By Matthew L.
