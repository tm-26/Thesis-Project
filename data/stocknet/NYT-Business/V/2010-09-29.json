We\u2019re going consider another in a series of recent cases in which the Supreme Court appears to have undermined Congressional efforts to protect hard-working Americans from powerful interests. In Skilling v. United States the court sided with an Enron executive who had been convicted of fraud and gutted a statute vital to combatting public corruption, corporate fraud and self-dealing. Now we have to explore the kinds of problematic conduct that may go unchecked in the wake of the Skilling decision and consider what Congress should do or could do to fill those gaps and bring strong enforcement against corrupt and fraudulent conduct.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Filling in the Gaps After the Skilling Decision", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Justice Department", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Senate", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Senate Committee on the Judiciary", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Westar Energy Incorporated", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2010-09-29T12:01:03+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Peter Lattman", "person": [{"firstname": "Peter", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Lattman", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "", "_id": "nyt://article/4b2913c1-6322-528e-a833-d9e12587f7ef", "word_count": 506, "uri": "nyt://article/4b2913c1-6322-528e-a833-d9e12587f7ef"}
