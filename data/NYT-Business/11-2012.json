While shareholders seem ready to approve the deal, it is less clear how they will view the retention bonuses for executives, which are subject to a separate vote. Qatar Holding, which has a 12 percent stake in Xstrata, said it would abstain from that vote, citing “the sensitivities concerning governance issues in the U.K.” It is also unclear what may happen if the merger is approved but the retention bonuses are rejected. “There is a chance the combination may backfire,” Bloomberg News writes.
