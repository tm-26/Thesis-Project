Cards are then dealt, and when a player’s sequence appears in a series of three consecutive cards, all cards in play are removed from the game as a winning trick.

The network used its platform of the Winter Olympics to tease out the announcement on Saturday, running a brief promotion. The news release that followed on Saturday night confirmed a few details: Tim Kring, who created the original “Heroes” in the 2006 television season, will be back as the executive producer. Before that, NBC is to create a digital series that will introduce the new story and characters. (Some original cast members may return.) Jennifer Salke, NBC’s president for entertainment, said in a statement that most details about the new version would be “appropriately shrouded in mystery.” Exactly when the show might appear is not known. Perhaps NBC will wait to see how the most immediate progenitor of the idea, Fox’s revival of “24,” fares this summer.
