Overseas shipments plummeted 49.4 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest decline since at least 1980, when the government started to keep comparable data, the Finance Ministry said in Tokyo. Economists predicted a 47.6 percent drop. “There’s been a structural shock to the manufacturing sector,” said Hiroshi Shiraishi, an economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo. “So yes, the government can create demand temporarily, but that can’t fill the export gap forever.” Japan’s gross domestic product shrank an annualized 12.1 percent last quarter, the biggest contraction among the world’s advanced economies and the country’s sharpest decline since the 1974 oil crisis. Japan has become more reliant on exports in the last decade, making it especially vulnerable to changes in global commerce. During Japan’s expansion of 2002 to 2007, exports as a portion of gross domestic product rose to 15.6 percent, from 10.4 percent.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "7", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Japan: Exports Plunge Almost 50%", "kicker": "World Business Briefing | Asia", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Japan: Exports Plunge Almost 50%", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Japan", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "International Trade and World Market", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Automobiles", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Electronics", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2009-03-25T05:27:50+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "World Business", "byline": {"original": "By Bloomberg News", "person": [{"firstname": "Bloomberg", "middlename": null, "lastname": "News", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/e318c532-e1ca-55d8-b9c1-3685cce0299c", "word_count": 168, "uri": "nyt://article/e318c532-e1ca-55d8-b9c1-3685cce0299c"}, {"abstract": "NYSE Euronext, which operates stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris, said it would cut fees on its European markets by about 20 percent.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/business/worldbusiness/25fobriefs-003.html", "snippet": "NYSE Euronext, which operates stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris, said it would cut fees on its European markets by about 20 percent.", "lead_paragraph": "NYSE Euronext, which operates stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris, said it would cut fees on its European markets by about 20 percent as it fights increasing competition in the region.
