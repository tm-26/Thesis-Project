He founded The Journal of Portfolio Theory. Harry Markowitz, who was awarded a Nobel Prize, for, essentially, creating portfolio theory, was one of his heroes.

The Boston Newspaper Guild sent a memo to members late Thursday, telling them that it had scheduled a vote for July 20. The guild and The Globe are still negotiating on a package of pay and benefit cuts, with face-to-face talks set to resume Monday, and people briefed on the discussions say a deal is close.  But in the meantime, The Globe’s owner, The New York Times Company, is insisting that a 23 percent pay cut is in effect for Guild members. The company unilaterally imposed the cut after guild members narrowly rejected a previous package of concessions, including a 10.3 percent salary reduction and deep cuts in benefits. The guild has challenged the unilateral cut with a complaint to the federal regulators, but that could take years to resolve. Guild bylaws require a 30-day wait before a contract proposal is voted on, and the 23 percent cut — which will show up in paychecks sent out next week — gives the union an incentive to start that clock ticking as soon as possible. So betting on the chance that the two sides will strike a deal early next week, the guild set a date for a vote. People briefed on the talks say negotiators have the outlines of a deal similar to the one that was rejected, but with a smaller pay cut in the range of 7 or 8 percent. The major stumbling block, they say, is dealing with the 23 percent cut, which would have been in effect for more than a month. The guild wants to find a way to repay some or all of that money to its members.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Globe Update: Union Sets Contract Vote", "kicker": "Media Decoder", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-06-19T14:21:49+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Media", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "Media", "byline": {"original": "By Richard Pérez-Peña", "person": [{"firstname": "Richard", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Pérez-Peña", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/cc208d36-3769-52cb-aa11-9d7273c3430f", "word_count": 309, "uri": "nyt://article/cc208d36-3769-52cb-aa11-9d7273c3430f"}, {"abstract": "The uncertainties of a chronic illness can include job insecurity.
