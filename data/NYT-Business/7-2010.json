He also plans to ask them to reimburse the government for those payouts and to halt any future ones until the taxpayer money is returned. Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master for compensation, put the six companies on a list of 17 banks that he found made $1.6 billion of questionable payments to senior bankers in 2008 and early 2009.
