Fidentia was placed under administration last February, accused of stealing client funds, with losses estimated at as much as 1 billion rand ($130 million). An investigation found that the company had invested in private equity ventures outside the mandate given by investors and its license conditions, and that client funds had been used to pay for the personal expenses of its chairman, Arthur Brown. Mr. Brown, who has denied wrongdoing, is to face trial by Oct. 3, the South African Press Association reported last month.
