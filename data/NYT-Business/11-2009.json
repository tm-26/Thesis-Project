Mr. Touradji and his firm were accused of using confidential information about Amaranth’s trading strategy and its positions to unjustly profit. Touradji Capital denied Amaranth’s allegations, saying that its conduct in assuming the risk of Amaranth’s base metal portfolio was professional and lawful. “Amaranth has received and evaluated additional information regarding the transaction, including trading records and other information voluntarily provided by Touradji Capital, that is consistent with Touradji Capital’s position that it did not violate the agreement with Amaranth and did not misuse Amaranth’s proprietary information,” Amaranth said in a statement. “Accordingly, Amaranth has withdrawn its summons and notice and elected not to serve a complaint against Touradji Capital.” “Amaranth’s decision to withdraw its claims vindicates our position that we acted appropriately and with the utmost of professionalism,” Mr. Touradji said in a statement. “It also clearly validates our previous statement that the Amaranth suit was based on the misinformation of two disgruntled former employees involved in separate litigation with T.C.M.” The two former employees are Robert Vollero and Gentry Beach. The men sued Touradji Capital last December, contending that they were owed $50 million in unpaid bonuses. The hedge fund filed a countersuit against the men this month alleging that the two men had lied about their abilities, stole company secrets and defamed the firm.
