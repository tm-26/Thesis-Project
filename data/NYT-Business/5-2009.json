The banks dropped the appeal at a hearing in Milan on Monday. The prosecutor is considering a May 7 request by the securities firms to put up about 100 million euros ($140 million) in exchange for having the assets returned, the lawyers said. Milan is suing the four banks after it lost money on derivatives it bought from the lenders in 2005. The banks earned about 101 million euros ($141.5 million) in what prosecutors called illicit profit from arranging the contracts. Officials for Deutsche Bank and Depfa declined to comment. The claims will be discussed in the course of the investigation, said UBS's lawyer Giuseppe Bana. Given \"the very short notice between the filing by the prosecutor of a large volume of documentation and the date set for the hearing it has not been possible adequately to address the relevant issues in time for the hearing.
