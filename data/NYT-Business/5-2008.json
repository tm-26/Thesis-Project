It was the 11th fare increase of the year that all six major carriers had joined in. Despite the wide-ranging fare increases, airlines have been “very cautious” about increasing fares on routes where there is competition from Southwest, JetBlue and other low-cost carriers, Mr. Seaney said.

Bell asked the court to rule by June 30, the closing date for the deal.
