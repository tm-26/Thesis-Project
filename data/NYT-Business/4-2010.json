She speaks with Claire Cain Miller, The Times technology reporter who covers Twitter, about the company’s moves toward building its own tools for the microblogging service, and the concerns among developers who fear that Twitter might turn into a competitor. Independent developers have created some 70,000 apps that let users do things like track messages on cellphones, monitor multiple Twitter accounts, shorten link addresses and post photos on the service.Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway, is also a strong advocate of promoting science and technology education. J.D. Biersdorfer chats with Mr. Kamen about his own early inspirations and about the nonprofit group he founded to encourage interest in these fields among the young. The organization, called First  (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), holds its 19th annual championship, with competitions in robotics, gaming and Lego construction, April 15-17 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.You might expect your brand new computer to have a clean hard drive, only to find programs installed on it that you didn’t ask for, or trial versions of software that pester you to buy the full version or sign up for a service.
