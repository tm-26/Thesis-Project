The surprising part is that it didn't plummet even more.  After closing at $30 Friday, Bear's stock hovered at about $4 late Monday morning, suggesting that investors expected to get something more than what JPMorgan has offered. But what? The securities firm was nearly forced to shut its doors because of a severe liquidity crunch. As a company that was preparing a bankruptcy filing over the weekend in case the sale effort failed, Bear seems to be in no position to negotiate.   A number of possibilities come to mind.  Investors may think that JPMorgan will increase its price, if only to avoid being seen as a vulture. Theoretically, Bear's shareholders can vote against the deal, though it would take 12 months to reject it fully under Sunday's merger agreement.  Though the deal price is about $270 million, JPMorgan has said that the true cost of acquiring Bear will be much higher -- as much as $6 billion -- when litigation, severance and other costs are taken into account. So in principle, increasing the per-share price would have a relatively small effect on the overall cost of buying Bear.  Wall Street seems to think JPMorgan is getting a huge bargain: Shares of JPMorgan were up 10 percent Monday, even as other financial firms took a nosedive. Its market capitalization grew by $12 billion, paying for Bear Stearns several times over.  Investors may also be putting hope in the idea that another bidder could step up, such as a private equity firm.  That could be difficult, however. Many analysts think JPMorgan's close ties to Bear, including its role as the go-between for Bear's federally backed bailout loan, have already put it at an advantage over other buyers.  And JPMorgan has another leg up over a rival bidder: Bear has already given JPMorgan the \"irrevocable\" option to buy its New York headquarters even if the takeover deal falls through, according to the merger agreement, which Bear posted on its Web site Monday.   Finally, Bear shareholders may see another potential source of funds: lawsuits.   A report from Reuters on Monday suggested that law firms were being inundated with calls from angry investors looking for answers -- and, presumably, some payouts for their pain.
