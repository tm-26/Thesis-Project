As for luggage, with a sharp increase in the number of checked bags because tighter security procedures reduced the number of carry-on bags, airlines mishandled bags at a rate of 6.73 per 1,000 passengers, a slight increase over 2005 (6.64 per 1,000 passengers).", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "9", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Memo Pad", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2007-02-13T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Joe Sharkey", "person": [{"firstname": "Joe", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Sharkey", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/998cf082-0e32-5bb2-a4b2-3566d30da85f", "word_count": 622, "uri": "nyt://article/998cf082-0e32-5bb2-a4b2-3566d30da85f"}, {"abstract": "Many forecasters are worried that the latest economic expansion is running out of steam, just as workers have finally begun to reap some of the spoils.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/business/13growth.html", "snippet": "Many forecasters are worried that the latest economic expansion is running out of steam, just as workers have finally begun to reap some of the spoils.", "lead_paragraph": "It is five years into an economic expansion and most Americans are still waiting for their share.
