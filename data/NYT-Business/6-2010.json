In today’s post, I will leave all whimsy aside, and show you that the universe we inhabit is stranger that our fictitious imaginings. Today we will explore a fundamental and almost unbelievable result of Quantum Mechanics (QM) through a set of simple puzzles. This famous result is “Bell’s Interconnectedness Theorem” which was discovered by the physicist John Stewart Bell in 1964. Bell’s theorem has been called by physicist Henry Stapp “the most profound discovery of Science.” It is profound because it shows that the universe has the property of non-locality: two particles can be light years apart, yet they are linked to each other instantaneously. How instantaneously? Recent measurements have shown that this phenomenon occurs more than 10,000 times the speed of light! In order to show that the universe in non-local, Bell showed that a certain simple and obvious inequality – Bell’s inequality – is violated. Amazingly, the only math that you need to understand this profound inequality is contained in the following simple problem.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Numberplay: Spooky Action at a Distance", "kicker": "Wordplay", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2010-06-21T18:48:39+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Crosswords & Games", "byline": {"original": "By Pradeep Mutalik", "person": [{"firstname": "Pradeep", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Mutalik", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "", "_id": "nyt://article/a775cbf0-ca3a-5773-9f93-3a1bd58c418d", "word_count": 1842, "uri": "nyt://article/a775cbf0-ca3a-5773-9f93-3a1bd58c418d"}, {"abstract": "Andreessen Horowitz is undergoing a growth spurt and creating a new kind of venture capital firm.", "web_url": "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/andreessen-horowitz-grows-up/", "snippet": "Andreessen Horowitz is undergoing a growth spurt and creating a new kind of venture capital firm.", "lead_paragraph": "Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm that was started just one year ago, has already made a name for itself in Silicon Valley and is building a new kind of venture capital firm in the process.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Andreessen Horowitz Grows Up", "kicker": "Bits", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2010-06-21T18:52:38+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Technology", "byline": {"original": "By Claire Cain Miller", "person": [{"firstname": "Claire", "middlename": "Cain", "lastname": "Miller", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "", "_id": "nyt://article/7c596edb-4734-5363-ad53-0e3853db1c2f", "word_count": 540, "uri": "nyt://article/7c596edb-4734-5363-ad53-0e3853db1c2f"}, {"abstract": "Gmail updated its Web application Monday, making downloadable apps for the iPad and browser-based online Web applications look more alike.", "web_url": "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/youve-got-web-based-gmail/", "snippet": "Gmail updated its Web application Monday, making downloadable apps for the iPad and browser-based online Web applications look more alike.", "lead_paragraph": "In the world of mobile devices and slate computers, the difference between a downloadable application and Web application is increasingly blurring. In many cases the two can look strikingly similar, using homogeneous design and interaction techniques.
