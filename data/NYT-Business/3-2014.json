They call themselves Runa, which translates to “fully alive human being.” Guayusa is a caffeinated tree leaf, and we sell it and use it to make our bottled beverages.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "6", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "xlarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 544, "width": 600, "subType": "xlarge", "crop_name": "articleLarge", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 544}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "jumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-jumbo.jpg", "height": 928, "width": 1024, "subType": "jumbo", "crop_name": "jumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "superJumbo", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-superJumbo.jpg", "height": 1234, "width": 1361, "subType": "superJumbo", "crop_name": "superJumbo", "legacy": {}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbLarge", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2014/03/11/business/Flier/Flier-thumbLarge.jpg", "height": 150, "width": 150, "subType": "thumbLarge", "crop_name": "thumbLarge", "legacy": {}}], "headline": {"main": "Fruitful but Tough Adventures in the Amazon", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Fruitful but Tough Adventures in the Amazon", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Business Travel", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Ecuador", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "AMAZON JUNGLE", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Runa LLC", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2014-03-10T22:13:01+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "International Business", "byline": {"original": "By Dan MacCombie", "person": [{"firstname": "Dan", "middlename": null, "lastname": "MacCombie", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/68a15705-45f0-52a8-ad9d-95d8b19e4ec9", "word_count": 613, "uri": "nyt://article/68a15705-45f0-52a8-ad9d-95d8b19e4ec9"}, {"abstract": "Energy companies have struggled to meet demand during the coldest winter in recent memory, and they have relied on coal plants that are soon to close.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/business/energy-environment/coal-to-the-rescue-this-time.html", "snippet": "Energy companies have struggled to meet demand during the coldest winter in recent memory, and they have relied on coal plants that are soon to close.", "lead_paragraph": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — When the temperature here dropped into the teens this winter, ice formed on the inside of Ernestine J.

350 miles, about a half-day’s drive.

Perhaps the greatest distance between the two counties is this: Fairfax is a place of the haves, and McDowell of the have-nots. Just outside of Washington, fat government contracts and a growing technology sector buoy the median household income in Fairfax County up to $107,000, one of the highest in the nation. McDowell, with the decline of coal, has little in the way of industry. Unemployment is high. Drug abuse is rampant.
