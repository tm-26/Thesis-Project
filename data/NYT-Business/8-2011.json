As it should — these market vortexes are posing grave dangers to the global economy right now. A national debt crisis is a bank run writ large, says Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and co-author with Carmen M. Reinhart of “This Time Is Different,” a history of financial crises. When a country like Greece goes deep into debt, bond investors start to worry they won’t get their money back. What can happen next is a debt spiral, a vicious circle of sinking confidence, rising borrowing costs and, ultimately, rising debt burdens. As investors lose confidence in a country, its bond prices drop, its bond yields rise and its government must pay higher interest rates to borrow. That, in turn, deepens the debt problem — and the whole thing starts over again. Debt spirals are dangerous, but they aren’t inevitable. “Country debt crises are essentially political,” Mr. Rogoff says. Governments can often stem the crisis by reducing spending, raising taxes or both. But such steps are particularly difficult — and politically unappetizing — when growth is slack, as it is now in much of the world. Tightening the belt slows growth even more, eroding tax revenue and — you guessed it — increasing the debt burden, at least in the short term. Of course, the best way to avoid a debt spiral is to avoid running up a lot of debt in the first place — when the economy is doing well. “If you walk outside without a raincoat and the sun is shining, you are fine,” Mr. Rogoff says. “But if it starts pouring, you are going to get wet.” — <em>DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN</em>", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/08/14/business/markets-debt-spiral.html", "snippet": "DEBT spirals: the term sounds ominous.

Goldfarb was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a scheme that involved a hedge fund trader and two corporate lawyers.", "lead_paragraph": "A federal judge sentenced a personal-injury lawyer, Jason C. Goldfarb, to three years in prison for his role in an insider trading scheme that involved a hedge fund trader and two corporate lawyers. Mr. Goldfarb, who worked at Brecher Fishman Pasternack Walsh Tilker & Ziegler, pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme with Zvi Goffer, a former trader at the Galleon Group, the hedge fund run by Raj Rajaratnam. He admitted to receiving tips about impending corporate mergers from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, two low-level associates at the law firm Ropes & Gray, and then passing them to Mr. Goffer. During an April court appearance, Mr. Goldfarb, who earned college and law degrees from Villanova, said that Mr. Goffer, a friend, approached him shortly after his law school graduation and asked if he knew any corporate lawyers. Mr. Goldfarb said he eventually introduced Mr. Goffer to Mr. Cutillo, his college roommate. Both Mr. Cutillo and Mr. Santarlas have pleaded guilty to leaking information about takeovers involving 3Com and Axcan Pharma. Mr. Goffer took his case to trial and was convicted by a jury in June.", "print_section": "B", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Lawyer Sentenced in Insider Trading Case", "kicker": "Business Briefing | Legal News", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Lawyer Sentenced in Insider Trading Case", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Rajaratnam, Raj", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Insider Trading", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2011-08-20T01:08:29+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Peter Lattman", "person": [{"firstname": "Peter", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Lattman", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Brief", "_id": "nyt://article/6ce8ca94-6b8e-5ce9-9603-cfe8bc91023d", "word_count": 187, "uri": "nyt://article/6ce8ca94-6b8e-5ce9-9603-cfe8bc91023d"}, {"abstract": "Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, while tablets are flying off store shelves.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/technology/as-pcs-wane-companies-look-to-tablets.html", "snippet": "Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, while tablets are flying off store shelves.", "lead_paragraph": "Although the world is dependent on personal computers, making them has not been a great business for most American companies for almost a decade.

decade-long effort to extract patent royalties from Reynolds American on a way to reduce carcinogens in cigarettes. Losing the bid set off a 40 percent decline in its share price Friday. While the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington today upheld the validity of two Star patents, the panel said there was no need to retry the infringement case against Reynolds that Star lost in 2009. Judge Randall Rader said in the 2-to-1 opinion that a new trial would not change the outcome as “there was substantial untainted evidence before the jury to support a verdict of noninfringement.” The patents cover a curing process that prevents “bacterial activity” in tobacco leaves, resulting in the lowest levels of cancer-causing nitrosamines, according to Star. Stock in the company, which is based in Glen Allen, Va., fell $1.19, or nearly 40 percent, to $1.81 a share.
