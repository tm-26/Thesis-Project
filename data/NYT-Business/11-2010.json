The president pleads for patience with Jon Stewart and promises to start focusing on the deficit next term. Blogger Justin Fox explains the deficit.

Earnings doubled at the Kaplan education unit, which accounts for almost two-thirds of revenue. Still, enrollment growth for higher education programs slowed, and the company said that pending government regulation of commercial colleges and a new free-trial period for students might hurt earnings. Revenue at the newspaper division rose 5 percent to $163.4 million. The Post’s print ad sales rose 3 percent to $72 million.

Apax will acquire about 85 percent of the company, with Advantage’s existing management owning the rest. Advantage, based in Irvine, Calif., is a leading sales and marketing agency for consumer goods, working with clients like J. M. Smucker and Johnson & Johnson to maximize the value of their brands.

J. W. Childs and BAML Capital Partners, formerly Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity, acquired the closely held Advantage in 2006 for $1.05 billion.
