Last week NBC announced it was renewing five drama series, including two, “Revolution” and “Chicago Fire,” that the network introduced this season. “Grimm,” arguably the network’s most reliable drama, was another show that was renewed; it holds up Friday night for the network and has experienced a ratings increase of 14 percent this season. The ratings for “Law & Order Special Victims Unit” have descended to just about survival level, but that show will return in a move that has been a ritual for the network for 15 years. “Parenthood,” the well-regarded family drama that performed well this year (up 8 percent), had been truncated to only 15 episodes, a sign that the network did not have the most faith in its endurance before this season started. That was also a sign that cost was a factor in considering its fate: “Parenthood” has a big budget and an enormous cast, with several star-name actors, including Lauren Graham, Peter Krause and Dax Shepard. A renewal order had been in some doubt until last week because of those budget concerns, but NBC announced that “Parenthood” would be back and with a full order of 22 episodes. The NBC announcement didn’t stop President Obama from taking a little shot at the network’s prime-time woes at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner on Saturday night. Joking about his recent performance at a basketball demonstration, the president said: “I took 22 shots and made 2 of them. That’s right, 2 hits and 20 misses.
