Users can log onto the program from anywhere in the world, as long as they can get to a computer with Internet access. Given that technology is one of the one of the sectors the Labor Department predicts will see the greatest growth in the next 10 years, this seems to be a good matchup between an industry needing people and people in need of job training.
