It’s enough of a task to come to grips with Mr. Wright’s skills at the keyboard and ability to go long and glorious — last spring he wrote a heave about Carlos Slim, the Mexican mogul who bought a piece of a certain little newspaper — but now we find out he pounds a keyboard that makes music as well. And if that isn’t sickening enough, WhoDo, which includes some other hacks turned musicians like John Burnett of NPR, will be backing Ruby Jane Smith, the 14-year-old fiddling phenom who has tongues wagging every which way every time she plays. Most journalists, including those of us at Decoder, are challenged to get a toe tapping in time to the music, so excuse us for not jumping for joy at the specter of journo-journeymen musicians.
