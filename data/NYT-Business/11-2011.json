The company will also cover $50,000 in Mr. Michaels’s legal fees. Mr. Michaels resigned under pressure, following reporting in The New York Times that detailed numerous instances of outlandish, often sexual behavior by Mr. Michaels and other top executives. The Tribune reported that he had demanded $900,000, the pro-rated portion of his 2010 management bonus, arguing that he “was effectively ‘terminated without cause,’ which would trigger the payment under terms of the bonus plan.” The payment needs to be approved by a bankruptcy court judge.In Tuesday night’s Republican presidential debate on CNN, which was devoted to national security issues, The Caucus live blog took note of the higher profile of Representative Ron Paul, the libertarian from Texas, who often can be hard to spot at these seemingly weekly encounters. As Trip Gabriel wrote for The Caucus, Mr. Paul’s campaign “had claimed after the last debate hosted by CBS News that he got only 90 seconds of air time,” but Tuesday night he played a more central role, serving as a dramatic foil to his rivals.

That’s because Blitzer didn’t know about them either when the two men sat down.” During that first segment of three, CNN producers began to see posts to Twitter that mentioned the coming WAGA story. “While seated during a commercial break, Blitzer then asked Cain about the Atlanta report and the candidate acknowledged that his campaign had been contacted about it and would be willing to discuss it on air,” Michael Calderone of The Huffington Post reported.
