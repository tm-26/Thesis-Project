Since Jan 23, United States citizens as well as those from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean have been required for the first time to present a valid passport when entering the United States by air. A rush for passports has created long processing delays, partly because of confusion among some travelers, who mistakenly thought they needed a passport to return to the United States from Canada or Mexico by car. That requirement will not take effect until next year. Maura Harty, the assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, said that the demand for passports was “over and beyond even the enormous demand we had expected,” leading to the delays. In response, the State Department adjusted the rules so that through Sept. 30, those who can show proof they have applied for a passport, even if they have not received it, are exempt. The required documents are a government-issued photo ID and a printout showing that they have applied for a passport, which can be downloaded from travel.state.gov.passport.
