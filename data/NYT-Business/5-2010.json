The six-member commission ordered both sides to submit arguments on whether an import ban should be imposed. Avago, based in Singapore, filed the complaint a year ago, seeking to block fiber optic components like transmitters, receivers and transceivers made by Emcore in Thailand. The patent found to be infringed, issued in 1994, is related to features of optical communications systems that transit digital information using light waves.

"lead_paragraph": "It’s Memorial Day. As we remember the heroes who laid down their lives for freedom, let us also spare a thought for a hero of the mind, who passed away some days ago at the age of 95. When I first encountered Martin Gardner’s columns in “Scientific American” as a schoolboy many years ago, my reaction was one of awe. Here was pure intelligence incarnate, I thought, coming up with puzzles of mind-bending difficulty month after month and explaining the ideas behind them with crystal clarity. I was convinced that Martin Gardner was the smartest man in the world. The profusion of his writings, their quality and the sheer length of time that he kept on producing them, month after month, were just mind-boggling. When he retired from “Scientific American” in 1981, I was convinced that no one could fill his shoes. Although I much admired Douglas Hofstadter, who replaced him, and was a great fan of “Gödel, Escher, Bach” I just knew that no one else could keep this up for as long as Martin Gardner had.
